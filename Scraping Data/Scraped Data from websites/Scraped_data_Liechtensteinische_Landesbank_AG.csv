Our holistic advice
Schedule a consultation
Identify your investor profile
Innovation and expertise
Comprehensive advice based on a personal relationship of trust – that is our tradition. We accompany you individually right from the first conversation all the way to the continuous optimisation of your investment strategy. We augment this good tradition with continuous innovation and the latest information technology.
Four steps to managing your assets successfully
Our first step is to analyse your asset situation and develop possible scenarios. Together with you, we design your personal investment strategy. We continuously monitor your portfolio risks and actively recommend suitable investment opportunities to you. Together, we regularly review your goals – and make adjustments where necessary. Using four factors for success, we offer you comprehensive, competent, and innovative asset management:
Understanding your situation
Your individual needs and wishes and your financial goals and circumstances form the basis for identifying your personal investor profile. 80% of investment success depends on the strategy chosen. Our experience shows that investor needs are generally concentrated on a small number of risk/reward profiles. We therefore offer six investment strategies – risk-controlled in the reference currencies CHF, EUR, and USD.
Defining your strategy
Of course we also take individual wishes into account in regard to markets, currencies, and other factors. Even implementation based on specific themes (sustainability, demographics, dividend opportunities) is possible at any time. We visualise your investment strategy for you in a simple and understandable way. We can show you interactively how your assets would have developed during historical market events. Test how well your strategy would have performed in a past economic crisis compared with other investment strategies.
Implementing your strategy
Based on your personal investment strategy, your individual wishes, and the bank's market analyses and recommendations, you will receive a customised investment proposal that aims to achieve the best possible risk/reward ratio. This proposal shows you clearly and understandably why the recommendations are the best solution for your situation, providing the ideal basis for your implementation decision.
Monitoring your strategy
We use innovative technology to monitor your portfolio systematically. Where action needs to be taken, we will send you according to your advisory model a new investment proposal. In that way, you can minimise risks and take advantage of market opportunities.

Foreign-exchange trading at LLB PDF
Risks in securities trading PDF
The LLB's foreign exchange business helps you engage in demanding international trades. We offer you comprehensive trading in spot and futures/forward transactions as well as swaps, derivatives, and other structured products. When making a trade, this lets you hedge exchange rate risks and thus potential losses during the payment period. These structured products also offer possibilities for income optimisation.
Spot transactions are market transactions that must be realised immediately or at short notice. As a rule, the settlement period is limited to a maximum of two trading days. This is in contrast to futures, forward, and option transactions, where the transaction becomes due at a later date but at a price already fixed on the trade date.
Foreign exchange transactions are quite complex. As an investor, it is therefore advisable to be aware of the associated opportunities and possible risks. Structured solutions make it easier to calculate risks in this respect and thus participate in positive exchange rate developments. In addition, such an investment can also contribute to diversification of the investor's portfolio.

Energy-efficient refurbishment

Energy-efficient refurbishment – The savvy way to save on energy costs now
Schedule a consultation
Components for energy-efficient refurbishment
Energy-efficient refurbishment involves upgrading buildings to minimise the energy used.
There are many possibilities when it comes to energy-efficient refurbishments. Before you get started, it is best to get an overview of the different options available. 
There are two important ground rules:
Reduce energy consumption by adding or improving insulation
Replace oil or gas heaters with a sustainable alternative
On the one hand, energy-efficient refurbishment has the advantage of reducing ongoing energy costs and CO₂ emissions. On the other hand, the refurbishment contributes to a more comfortable indoor environment and reduces the need for heating, as less cold air can enter the building from the outside.
Insulation – reducing energy consumption
""Good insulation is the basis for an energy-efficient building. But what does it mean?""
Most of the energy used goes into heating. Air-tight walls can therefore reduce energy consumption significantly.
This has several advantages:
In winter, although less heating is required, the property is better insulated and feels warmer.
In summer, the property is protected from overheating – air conditioning is often no longer necessary.
Energy consumption is reduced, leading to lower running costs.
Does the entire building need to be insulated, or is it more effective to only insulate individual areas? The possible insulation surfaces can be roughly divided into two groups, each of which has different advantages:
Top-floor ceiling
Warm air rises to the top. This is where most heat is lost. The top-floor ceiling is therefore a good place to start when retrofitting a property for energy efficiency.
Exterior walls
Insulating exterior walls not only reduces the energy used, but also improves the indoor environment. There are a number of ways to achieve this, including external thermal insulation composite systems or a ventilated façade using materials such as mineral wool or sheep’s wool.
Basement ceiling
Up to ten per cent of the energy used for heating can be lost through an uninsulated ceiling in the basement. Insulation of the basement ceiling generally retains more heat indoors and creates a pleasantly warm floor on the ground floor.
Windows
To further optimise energy savings, energy-efficient windows are required. This allows for seamless insulation, reducing thermal bridging in the building envelope. As well as improving thermal insulation, it also improves acoustic insulation, which is a pleasant side effect.
Heating – sustainable sources of energy
""Phasing out oil and gas"" is the guiding principle for new or replacement heating systems. And for good reason: the running costs for oil and gas have been increasing over the past few years. The effects of climate change are visible everywhere and require a rapid change of course towards renewable energy sources.
""As part of a complete refurbishment package, the source of energy – the heating system – should also be checked.""
Many questions come up when you change your heating system:
What are the alternatives?
Is it technically possible to make the change for my property?
Is it a worthwhile investment?
An energy consultant can answer these and all other questions. Below you will find a guide to getting started:
Solar energy
Photovoltaic systems convert sunlight directly into electricity using solar cells in solar panels. This means that the electricity can be used directly, such as in household appliances. Or it can be stored in batteries. The battery is needed to provide solar power even when there is little or no sunlight.
The installation of a photovoltaic system on the roof is usually straightforward and can be done by a professional. They are often used in combination with another type of heating system. In this way, energy costs can be reduced in the long term and the environment protected.
By contrast, solar thermal systems use the energy of the sun collected by solar panels to generate heat. This heat can then be used to heat water and support the heating function.
Wood energy
Wood is a sustainable and renewable resource if it is locally sourced and only as much is used as can grow back at the same time. Burning wood releases energy. This in turn can be used to heat water and for heating. In addition, burning wood, with the right fuels and correct operation, does not pollute the air. Pellets, logs or wood chips are most commonly used for this purpose. 
Ambient heat
Heat pumps are currently one of the most popular heating systems for new buildings, especially detached and semi-detached houses. There are different types of heat pumps that draw their energy from the environment.
However, the basic function is always the same:
The heat pump uses an environmental heat source such as the ground, groundwater or air. 
This heat is pumped to a higher temperature using electrical energy and then released into the heating system. 
There are also different options regarding the pump action.
Many heat pumps can also be used for cooling in summer, similar to an air conditioning system.
An expert can help you find out which one is right for your property.
District heating
District heating usually involves a power plant producing heat as an industrial by-product or specifically for the power plant. District heating in the form of circulating hot water can be connected directly to the property using a piped system. A transfer station is located at the property, which acts as a heat exchanger and transfers the heat energy to the house. In addition, there is often a hot water tank that stores the thermal energy and heats the water for the property.
Mortgage and home finance options
We can offer you different solutions depending on your objectives and requirements. And as different as the mortgage models may be, there is one thing that they all have in common: they are based on interest rates that are either variable or fixed for a certain period of time. Combining different models for flexible solutions, we use both to your advantage. We will be happy to advise you.

LLB medium-term bonds PDF
Medium-term notes are a form of securities saving with medium to longer maturities. As an investor, you are a lender and acquire a bearer bond. In return, you receive regular income from the borrower in the form of interest. This fixed and annual interest is credited directly to your account.
Long-term investments that can be planned - the investment form for safety-conscious investors
Medium-term notes generally offer higher long-term earnings opportunities than a traditional savings account. Our medium-term notes are used by many savers and investors as a secure form of investment, enabling them to benefit from securities saving over a longer investment period. You can choose from maturities ranging from two to ten years. At maturity, the nominal value of the medium-term note will be repaid to you as the investor. With as little as CHF 5'000, you can invest in selected medium-term notes and secure attractive earnings opportunities.
Your benefits
Additional income: Attractive annual interest payments on your account
Interest rate level: Generally higher than for a traditional savings account
Investment duration: Choose freely among maturities between two and ten years
Liquidity: High capacity as collateral if a credit need arises
Combination of long-term orientation and short-term availability
Your investment in medium-term notes keeps you flexible, increases your diversification, and at the same time pays you regular market-based interest – always in line with your needs.
Regular interest income
With your investment in medium-term notes, you earn additional income thanks to annual interest payments.
Individually chosen maturities
Whether at least two, five, or at most ten years - you determine the term individually and according to your needs.
Flexible when needed
If credit needs arise, medium-term notes can be used as collateral.

Determine the need for refurbishment step by step
For LLB, the issue of sustainability is a key concern and therefore also a part of the ACT-26 strategy.
With well-trained employees, innovative products and exciting tools, the Bank is striving to show clients how they can benefit from an energy-efficient refurbishment. In this regard, the carbon and renovation calculator will help you determine when to renovate your property and how much it will cost. With the aid of the subsidy calculator, you can identify the estimated, location-dependent subsidies.

LLB time deposits – the safe investment option
With time deposit investments with fixed interest rates, you can invest for a term of more than one to ten years and receive fixed annual interest in line with the market.
Downloads
LLB time deposits PDF
With this form of investment for the safety-conscious, you invest an amount of CHF 5'000 or more for more than one to maximum ten years. You can also make your investment in a variety of currencies. The interest rate is fixed in advance for the term you choose. That way, you secure interesting yield opportunities that you can rely on.
Time deposit investments normally offer the opportunity of achieving higher long-term returns than a classic savings account. Many savers and investors use them as a safe form of investment in order to also benefit over a longer investment period. The possible term ranges from one to ten years and can be individually chosen by you. Interest on this safe investment is paid annually at the interest fixed at the beginning – meaning you can reliably calculate the payment without any risk of it fluctuating. When the agreed term ends, your invested capital is repaid to you.
Your benefits
Calculable interest rate terms: the interest rate is fixed in advance for the entire term.
Flexible structure: you determine the amount and duration.
Safe investment: interest is fixed for the entire term.
No fees: no custody fees or commissions are charged.

Investment with a long-term perspective – for your future
Schedule a consultation
Your capital investment in bonds
With bonds, you acquire an individual partial debenture in the form of a security according to the amount of your investment. Interest is paid at a fixed or variable rate over the entire term of the bond. 
Downloads
Bonds at a glance PDF
The price of bonds and thus their value depend on the borrower's creditworthiness and the general interest rate development on the capital market. The main advantage of a bond is that it is less volatile than equities. Bonds are subject to fewer potential price fluctuations and are ideally suited as an investment option with a long-term perspective.
Whether national governments, cantons, municipalities, or private companies – all of them often cover their financing needs by issuing bonds. These mostly long-term bonds are used to raise borrowed capital on the free capital market. Depending on their maturity, these securities are  referred to as short-term or long-term. As an investor, you receive interest payments on your invested capital. This interest is usually paid out once a year. At the end of the term, the par value of the bond will be repaid to you as an investor. All in all, this makes bonds an attractive investment opportunity.
But the quality of the bond issued and thus the borrower's creditworthiness is of primary importance. This quality of bonds and of borrowers is regularly evaluated by rating agencies. A AAA rating stands for high creditworthiness and thus for expected servicing of interest and capital repayments by the borrower. On the other hand, the lowest D rating tends to point to the assumption that the borrower can most likely no longer make interest and capital repayments.
Our daily updated list of bonds provides an overview of selected bonds.
Your benefits
Investment horizon: Long-term perspectives for a tailored capital investment
Quality: Bonds evaluated by renowned rating agencies are available
Diversification: Diversification opportunity for building up assets
Interest: Annual interest payments ensure continuous income
Investment: Repayment of invested capital at maturity
Benefit from bonds in different ways
Plan your investments for the long term, risk-consciously, and with sufficient knowledge so that you know your assets are in good hands and you can concentrate on the essential things in life.
E-Banking discount
We offer a cost advantage when you buy bonds: 50% on our own brokerage fees.
Tailored selection
A daily updated list of bonds allows you to incorporate your personal investment preferences.
Limitation of risks
By investing in different bonds, you place your investment on a broader basis and reduce risks.

Diversify your investment as broadly as possible

Mortgages that adjust to your needs
With our different mortgage models, you can realise your dream of owning your own home or buying the property you've always longed for. Regardless of what you decide – our focus is always on your needs, and we are the partner at your side.
Depending on your goals and needs, we can offer you a wide variety of solutions.

We use both to your advantage and combine different models for flexible solutions.

Advice that fits you
Your personal contacts
Our advisory process to ensure your success
Where are you now? Where do you want to be? Do you want to delegate investment decisions, or do you want to be actively involved? These and many other questions arise when you decide which investment models and solutions are a good fit for you. We'll always be at your side when you answer these questions – we'll give you advice every step of the way and develop a holistic, customised concept for you.
The first step is to prepare your investor profile during a personal consultation. We take your personal situation into account: investment horizon, return goals, risk ability and willingness as well as sustainability preferences. Based on these personal preferences, we enter the design phase together and prepare your individual investment strategy that corresponds to your investment goals in terms of investment duration as well as your risk and sustainability profile. 
Your client advisor is your direct and personal contact from the very beginning. Your client advisor is supported by a team of specialists in private financial and pension planning as well as tax and asset structuring. For your success in all matters relating to investment advice and asset management, your client advisor works together with the proven experts of LLB Asset Management AG. This ensures an all-round high quality of advice that fits you, since defining your strategy is the most important step toward securing your financial future.
And of course we are always at your side to accompany the implementation of your strategy. We inform you regularly about the development of your assets. Together with you, we adjust your strategy when new opportunities arise or when changes on the market make adjustments necessary. Perfect banking means that you can count on us for the long run.
Do you know your investor profile? Find out within a matter of minutes what type of investor you are.
Identify your investor profile
Our pillars for advice that fits you
To identify what's important and to ensure your success, we always take a look at the big picture. Not only are we concerned with your assets and your investment goals – we also systematically employ the following three pillars when giving you advice. Our banking adjusts to you and your highest demands.
For us, private banking means:
Competence and reliability
We explain all the complex relationships to you, so that you have no open questions and are always able to understand where and how your money is invested.
Flexibility and individuality
Our focus is always on your wishes and goals, so that our advisory models adjust to your expectations.
Clarity and transparency
Our advice is clearly structured and made transparent to you. We communicate in an understandable way and suggest specific improvements to ensure optimal investment of your assets.
Your path to our private banking. Let us advise you in person.

The Lombard loan for private clients
You need money for an investment in the short term but do not want to sell your existing assets? Increase your liquidity with the Lombard loan and bridge financial bottlenecks quickly and easily.
Downloads
Lombard loan – Flexible financing solution for comprehensive wealth planning PDF
Lombard loans give you the option of taking advantage of investment opportunities with additional capital, diversifying investments, or better structuring your portfolio. This works by pledging existing assets such as equities, bonds, or savings to the lender.
This means you do not lose any assets and can invest because the earnings potential of existing securities is maintained.
Plan your assets
The Lombard loan is not only suitable for bridging your financial bottlenecks in the short term. As part of your asset planning, this loan option gives you the opportunity to take advantage of short-term investment opportunities on the market with additional capital investment. Pledging your assets also gives you the opportunity to structure and increase your portfolio more effectively. Since this  loan is secured by pledged securities, you can also benefit from lower interest rates.
Risks of the Lombard loan
Nevertheless, using securities as collateral entails risks such as price and currency fluctuations in addition to special advantages. If your investments lose value as a result, you have to incorporate additional assets into the loan. For a complete overview, please refer to our fact sheet. Or ask your client advisor directly – your client advisor will provide you with comprehensive information and explain all aspects in detail.
Your benefits
Additional capital without having to sell assets
Bridging of financial bottlenecks
Creation of new investment opportunities
Flexible and low-cost financing solution
Low-interest loan model
Easily expand your options
Quick, easy, a good match. With the Lombard loan, you can create more financial leeway in a short period of time to realise investments and purchases.
Take advantage of opportunities
Do you currently see worthwhile investment opportunities? Then a Lombard loan can extend your investment framework.
Benefit nicely
Since you're covering your Lombard loan with real collateral, you can benefit from favourable interest rates.
Keeping your finger at the pulse
Get more financial freedom and obtain additional capital for your individual investment with a Lombard loan.

Structured products: A smart combination
Structured products create new opportunities for private investors to profit in different market phases by individually combining a wide range of investment forms.
Structured products have the advantage of being able to offer added value for your portfolio in rising, steady, or falling markets. As individually controllable investment combinations, they consist of a classical investment – such as a share or bond – and one or more derivative financial instruments. A derivative financial instrument is a futures transaction whose price is derived from one or more underlying assets. Underlying assets may be equities, bonds, currencies, interest rates, commodities, hedge funds, private equity, or indirect real estate investments.
Pay attention to individual selection
However, not every structured product fits your personal investment strategy. And every investor has individual risk preferences. As your financial partner, it is important for us to consider your investment strategy holistically – because we want to support you competently with transparent products and investment concepts tailored to your investment profile. Structured products can be a good choice – provided they match your goals and needs.
Your benefits
Act flexibly in different market phases
Participation in expected market opportunities
Choose a tailored combination in the portfolio context
Special possibilities for capital protection or yield enhancement
This is what structured products can do for you
Structured products are characterised by significant factors that can help your investment strategy achieve more success.
Capital protection
Capital protection products can help you benefit from a change in the price of an underlying asset. At the same time, capital protection provides full or partial protection of the invested capital.
Yield enhancement
With yield enhancement products, the earnings potential of one or more underlying assets is sold. In return, the investor receives a discounted entry into the underlying asset or a coupon.
Participation
Participation products can be used to replicate the performance of one or more underlying assets and are characterised by their linear basic structure.

Our holistic advice
Schedule a consultation
Identify your investor profile
Innovation and expertise
Comprehensive advice based on a personal relationship of trust – that is our tradition. We accompany you individually right from the first conversation all the way to the continuous optimisation of your investment strategy. We augment this good tradition with continuous innovation and the latest information technology.
Four steps to managing your assets successfully
Our first step is to analyse your asset situation and develop possible scenarios. Together with you, we design your personal investment strategy. We continuously monitor your portfolio risks and actively recommend suitable investment opportunities to you. Together, we regularly review your goals – and make adjustments where necessary. Using four factors for success, we offer you comprehensive, competent, and innovative asset management:
Understanding your situation
Your individual needs and wishes and your financial goals and circumstances form the basis for identifying your personal investor profile. 80% of investment success depends on the strategy chosen. Our experience shows that investor needs are generally concentrated on a small number of risk/reward profiles. We therefore offer six investment strategies – risk-controlled in the reference currencies CHF, EUR, and USD.
Defining your strategy
Of course we also take individual wishes into account in regard to markets, currencies, and other factors. Even implementation based on specific themes (sustainability, demographics, dividend opportunities) is possible at any time. We visualise your investment strategy for you in a simple and understandable way. We can show you interactively how your assets would have developed during historical market events. Test how well your strategy would have performed in a past economic crisis compared with other investment strategies.
Implementing your strategy
Based on your personal investment strategy, your individual wishes, and the bank's market analyses and recommendations, you will receive a customised investment proposal that aims to achieve the best possible risk/reward ratio. This proposal shows you clearly and understandably why the recommendations are the best solution for your situation, providing the ideal basis for your implementation decision.
Monitoring your strategy
We use innovative technology to monitor your portfolio systematically. Where action needs to be taken, we will send you according to your advisory model a new investment proposal. In that way, you can minimise risks and take advantage of market opportunities.

LLB Compass. Comprehensive advice – wherever life takes you

Your needs and goals in life are as individual as you are. But depending on your phase and situation in life, your needs and goals may shift. Your advisory package and financial plan will have to adjust accordingly. With LLB Compass, we offer you the possibility to re-evaluate your overall situation and focus on the issues that are important to you. This allows you to choose the optimal financial and pension plan that fits your current life situation.
Real estate – your long-term financial security
The issue of real estate may come up in any phase of life – be it financing of your family's first home, paying off your mortgage before you retire, or maintaining your ability to pay your mortgage during retirement. Or are you looking to supplement your investments by purchasing real estate? No matter what your goals and needs are – LLB Compass allows you to focus on what is most important to you and to adjust your financial and pension benefits accordingly.
 
Would you like more information in advance on home ownership, mortgage financing, or affordable mortgage payments? Then use our real estate and financing calculator.
Professional changes – plan for your life
Your career is something that shapes your entire life. But what happens if changes occur? You can respond to changes in exactly the right way. LLB Compass helps you gain an overall picture, and we help you keep things manageable.
Career change
You are faced with a new professional challenge. Take this opportunity not only to work on your own personal development, but also to adjust your financial and pension planning. We will accompany you throughout all of your professional changes.
Part-time work/maternity
Would you like to work less and have more time for your family? Make sure you're covered, and provide for the future. We'll show you how the change in your income affects your budget and what this means for your individual financial and pension planning.
Self-employment
Let us support you in making the move into self-employment – we are also here for you in this life situation. Whether you need help preparing a budget, setting up a risk and retirement plan that is in line with your needs, or selecting a legal structure for your business, we will support you in your decision-making process.
Retirement
Decisions regarding retirement affect your whole life. For which retirement scenarios are you planning? What pension income can you expect after retirement? What is better for you: a life-long pension, or the capital from your pension scheme? Will you have saved enough money to ensure that you can maintain the standard of living you're accustomed to? Careful planning with LLB Compass helps you make the right decisions.
Ways of life – make sure you and your family are covered
Every individual's experience in life is unique – through all phases of life, we stand by your side and optimise your overall situation.
Cohabitation/patchwork families
There are many different ways to live together. We advise you on financial security and options that make sense in your current situation.
Marriage
Plan for your life together and your joint finances. As part of LLB Compass, we look at the big picture and provide you with comprehensive advice on financial security.
Children
Not only does the birth of a child change your life – your responsibility also increases. Make sure you and your family are covered financially. Keep in mind from the outset that your net household income will drop. It's better to think about long-term issues today rather than tomorrow, such as succession and estate planning. With LLB Compass, we can find the right ways to make sure your family is covered.
Divorce
Life events such as divorce always have legal and financial consequences. As part of our advisory packages, we help you with your reorientation and take account of the changed asset situation. Face your financial future with confidence!
Legal issues – think of tomorrow today
When undertaking comprehensive financial and pension planning, it's important to pay attention early on to the phases of life in which estate planning, inheritance, and self-determination become relevant.
Issues such as statutory succession and matrimonial property are part of the advice we provide. Our specialists and cooperation partners can provide more in-depth advice on these issues at any time. Have you received an inheritance and would like to use the new assets for your retirement? We can plan your future together.
LLB Compass – the right advice for you
No matter what you are interested in or what your goals are, we stand by your side with advice. Together, we look at your financial and pension situation and the options available to you. Do you have any questions about these issues or would you like to know more about our advisory packages? Get in touch with your advisors, or learn more about 360° advice in our brochure. You can also use our calculators to gain an initial overview.

Reclaim withholding taxes
Reclaim withholding taxes – optimise your after-tax return with us!
To the extent it makes economic sense and is allowed by law, we reclaim your recoverable portion of withholding taxes on dividends and interest payments. To help you with this complicated process, make use of the extended services of the Liechtensteinische Landesbank and the LLB Group.
Downloads
Reclaim withholding tax on investment income PDF
In most countries, income such as interest and dividends is subject to a withholding tax (Switzerland: anticipatory tax), which is deducted directly from your income. If a double taxation agreement (DTA) exists between your tax domicile and the issuing country and if you are eligible under that agreement, the withholding tax can be reclaimed in whole or at least in part.
Once you grant us power of attorney to do so, we can take care of the entire process of reclaiming withholding taxes for you.
Our services
Ongoing monitoring of the double taxation agreements in force
Filling out applications
All correspondence with involved offices and agencies
Monitoring of incoming payments
Crediting of recovered amounts
Your benefits
The bank's specialists take care of and monitor the time-consuming and complicated process.
No additional effort is required on your part.
You benefit from higher performance thanks to recovered, previously unused withholding tax amounts.

What is sustainable investment?
Investing money sustainably means investing in companies that promote good management of nature and people. With sustainable investments, the non-financial aspect of sustainability is also taken into account in the investment strategy alongside the three financial components (yield, security and liquidity). This means that the environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) factors are explicitly taken into account in the investment conditions.
Your benefits
Returns and sustainability combined
Our investment solutions combine the pursuit of optimal returns with sustainability.
Individual investment strategy
Choose the level of sustainability you want.
No extra charge
With us, sustainable investment is not a luxury. We offer our sustainable investment solutions at no extra charge.
A strong partner at your side
You benefit from our top-notch Asset Management team's expertise in sustainable investing.
You set a good example
Doing good pays off: set an example today for tomorrow.


Are you interested in investing your money sustainably? If so, we'll show you how to invest your assets safely.
Book an appointment now
We have consistently developed our range of sustainable investment solutions and offer investment advisory and asset management mandates with varying degrees of sustainability focus. We distinguish between “ESG” and “ESG+” in the implementation of our strategies. In addition to the previous criteria such as yield, security and liquidity, environmental (E), social (S) and corporate governance (G) characteristics are also specifically taken into account for our investment decisions. With “ESG+”, in addition to the above criteria, investment products are selected that make a concrete contribution to achieving environmental goals.
For both implementation variants, we apply our proven sustainability approach.
With our LLB Impact funds, we offer clients with an even stronger desire for sustainable investments products that meet this aspiration. These funds have a discernible and positive impact on people, the environment and the economy.

The LLB investment plan: Systematic investing is smart
Is now the right time to invest? Are the markets attractive right now, or would it be smarter to wait? Maybe you’re also asking whether you might miss the ideal time to invest if you hesitate. Many of our clients share these thoughts – and they are completely understandable. With our LLB investment plan, we can offer you a solution that minimises the risk of investing at an unfavourable time.
How exactly does the investment plan work?
You invest a defined investment amount in one of our LLB funds at staggered intervals over 3, 6, 9 or 12 months. The investment horizon depends on your investment strategy, but we recommend at least five years. The LLB investment plan can be reallocated or closed down at any time.
Currency
Minimum investment amount
Interest rate
Investment plan
CHF 10'000 0.75 %
EUR 10'000 2.00 %
USD 10'000 3.00 %
Your investment amount will initially be fully paid into your investment plan account. The investment in the fund will then automatically be made at monthly intervals, so you do not have to take any further action.
At the start, a 25 % initial investment will be made in asset management, while the remaining 75 % will be paid into your investment plan account. Investments will then automatically be made in asset management from this investment plan account at quarterly intervals, so you can sit back and let us handle it.

Your long-term capital investment in shares
Shares are securities. As a shareholder, you have a direct stake in the company and therefore its success. You can vote at the general meeting and are entitled to a distribution of profits (dividend). The share price depends on the current or expected earning power of the respective company as well as on the economic and commercial environment. This means that you can profit from rising stock prices, but you must also be able to accept pronounced fluctuations. For this reason, investing in shares requires a long-term investment horizon.
Your benefits
Tradeable at any time at the market price (if listed) e.g. via e-banking (online and mobile)
Voting rights at the general meeting
Participation in company profits in the form of dividends
Subscription entitlement for rights issues
Participation in company development and economic environment via share price changes
Higher long-term return opportunities than bonds

Risks in Securities Trading PDF
When investing in a single public limited company, the investor is solely dependent on the performance of this one share. If this declines significantly, the value of the investment decreases accordingly. Possible risks can be reduced very significantly with sensible diversification into several companies or asset classes. For lower volumes, diversification via investment funds is a good option.
Our daily updated overview of shares provides you with a good guide to interesting shares. We also recommend that you inform yourself about the key criteria governing share investment in the brochure ""Risks in Securities Trading"".

Derivative transactions – trade with our support
Derivatives are contractually regulated futures/forward transactions or option transactions whose valuation is derived from the development of one or more underlying variables. In this way, you can take targeted advantage of investment or market opportunities.
The terminology used to describe the world of the stock exchange is as diverse as the contracts traded there. This applies in particular to derivatives trading. Futures transactions or option transactions can be used for this purpose. The selected maturity is always an important factor in this context. The actual trading takes place either on special futures exchanges, such as EUREX, or over-the-counter (OTC). Options, futures, forwards, and swaps are among the most frequently traded derivative products. For a better understanding, we describe certain features of these products below.
Options
Options offer their buyers a choice of buying (call) or selling (put) shares or other securities at a certain market value (underlying asset). However, that right is limited in time until a given maturity date. An option that has not been exercised by that date expires. For each option, at least one market value is provided daily by the trading venue.
Forwards
Forwards are derivatives not listed on the stock exchange that are based on a contract to buy or sell a defined asset at a specified price or time in the future. This makes them the over-the-counter counterpart to futures. Typically, currencies or metals are traded by forwards.
Futures
Futures are standardised contracts traded on exchanges. A buyer undertakes to purchase a defined quantity of a security at a fixed price at a certain point in the future. The other contracting party undertakes to deliver accordingly.
Swaps
Swaps involve the exchange of liabilities or receivables. This is done at the level of interest rates or currencies. Any interest rate differences between different currencies are balanced by means of a swap rate. Swaps can act as an alternative to direct financing on international financial markets.
Your benefits
Comprehensive opportunities for derivatives trading
Take targeted advantage of investment and market opportunities
Forward-looking hedging of potential currency risks
Forward-looking trades with derivatives
Trading in derivatives requires certain conditions and knowledge of the details – if these are known, trading can be successful.
Everything at a glance
Our online platform LLB Quotes always helps you keep track of current developments.
Minimise risks
Trading in derivatives gives you the opportunity to temporarily minimise exchange rate risks. A total loss is possible with derivative transactions.
Better selection
By including derivatives, you can broaden your portfolio and take advantage of return opportunities.

Securities lending – additional return for you PDF
When you engage in securities lending and borrowing at the LLB, you always act as lender and we as a bank assume the role of borrower. You will receive a fee for the lending, the amount of which depends on the length of the lending period and the volume of the securities.

Your benefits

Income and expenses
We look at your current income/expense situation together. Based on this analysis, we make suggestions for optimising your savings ratio and covering any income gap.
Assets
Is your goal to build up assets? Together, we determine a suitable investor profile and define an investment strategy. If you already have assets, we are able to structure them according to your wishes.
Retirement planning
Supplementing public and occupational pension plans, private retirement planning is very specific to each individual. We evaluate which savings models will help you to get the most out of your retirement planning. If you are aiming to retire early, we will help you to achieve your goals.
Your questions, our solutions:
Own home and real estate
Together, we find out how a mortgage fits into your budget, what the tax consequences are, and whether it makes sense to draw on pension assets. We also examine how to finance your own home during retirement.
Financing
We calculate the affordability of a mortgage based on your income and assets, so that you can enjoy your home for the long term.
Your questions, our solutions:
Taxes
We analyse your tax burden and take measures to ensure sustainable tax optimisation. We also advise you on whether and how to withdraw pension assets.
Protection from risks
How good is your coverage in the event of disability due to accident or illness? And in the event of death, how well are your surviving dependents insured? We identify any underinsurance or overinsurance and recommend any necessary steps.
Estate, law, and self-determination
These topics are emotional for everybody. But it is still important to think about them early on. We'll support you.

Tax reporting
Reclaim withholding taxes
Make it easier to deal with your personal tax documentation
Depending upon your tax domicile, your investment schemes may be subject to different rules or different tax documentation requirements. We work with the appropriate tax reports in order to make your documentation more straightforward and understandable for you.

Drawing up tax documentation is normally a complex matter and, depending upon tax domicile, can be subject to specific requirements. In order to enable you to comply with your tax disclosure requirements in your particular tax domicile in a convenient and reliable manner, we offer you the appropriate tax reports along with transparent client reports. These will make it easier for you, amongst other things, to complete your tax return. Please note that we always need to receive your request for client reports by 9 January of the following year.
e-tax statement for Switzerland
The e-tax statement for Switzerland is the optimal solution for natural persons domiciled in Switzerland. In it we provide a clear listing of tax-relevant investment income and assets as well as of the withholding tax on your accounts and custody accounts in accordance with Swiss tax legislation. Thanks to the e-tax statement, you can easily import all values digitally into the tax return software for your canton.
Liechtenstein tax report
The Liechtenstein tax report contains all asset values required for the tax return as at 1 January of the respective tax year. You can carry over the values indicated into your tax return and file the tax report as an enclosure to your tax return.
Tax report for Germany
The tax report for Germany is intended for private individuals with tax domicile in Germany. It provides a clear record of all investment income relevant for tax purposes as well as sale transactions and withholding tax relating to your accounts and custody accounts. The figures can be transferred directly from our templates into the KAP (capital assets), KAP-INV (capital assets – investment income) and SO (other income) sections of your income tax declaration.
Tax reports for Austria, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands
The tax reports for Austria, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands are intended for private individuals with tax domicile in those countries. They contain all investment income relevant for tax purposes as well as sale transactions and withholding tax relating to your accounts and custody accounts according to the relevant applicable tax law. The automatic fill-in aid makes it even easier to complete your income tax return.
Additional information for Spain: disclosure of foreign assets (Modelo 720 Spain)
Persons resident in Spain are obliged to provide comprehensive information to the Spanish tax authorities concerning any banking assets held by them abroad above a particular value threshold. Our form 720 contains all information relevant for completing the electronic 720 disclosure, which must be submitted separately from the Spanish tax return.
UK tax report
The UK tax report is intended for private individuals with tax domicile in the United Kingdom (UK). It provides a clear record of the investment income relevant for tax purposes as well as sale transactions and withholding tax relating to your accounts and custody accounts according to the applicable tax law (period: 6 April until 5 April of the following year). Thanks to the automatic fill-in aid, our tax report makes it even easier to complete your income tax return.
General client report
The general client report is intended for clients with tax domiciles in other countries as well as for legal persons. This client report presents your income and expenses along with your gains and losses from sale transactions calculated according to the ""FiFo"" method (first-in-first-out) (period: calendar year).
