Market Update - April 2025 (One-Time Publication)
Investment Manager’ Commentary
The Net Asset Value (NAV) of IGF declined by 1.9% in March. Both the local and foreign portfolios recorded negative returns over the month, with the foreign portfolio exerting a greater drag on overall performance due to IGF’s higher exposure to foreign securities and the sharper drawdowns it experienced.
 In Mauritius, among the Fund’s key holdings, MCB Group Limited and Phoenix Beverages Group delivered positive returns. However, these gains were offset by declines in other local portfolio constituents, notably LUX Island Resort and MIWA Sugar. With regard to the performance of the broad market, the SEMTRI fell by 1.7% in March. Despite this monthly decline, the domestic equity market ended the first quarter in positive territory, with quarterly gains of 3.8%. Other notable market developments included Phoenix Beverages Group’s announcement of a potential acquisition of a majority stake in an overseas business. Additionally, the Stock Exchange of Mauritius approved the proposed listing of Stevenhills Ltd, a company operating in the sports betting sector.
 At the international level, rising uncertainty surrounding trade policy and concerns about stagflation—a scenario of elevated inflation alongside subdued growth—contributed to heightened volatility in equity markets. In USD terms, global equities declined by 4.0%, with developed markets (-4.5%) underperforming emerging markets (+0.6%). Developed markets were weighed down by the performance of the US equity market (-5.9%), where four out of the “Magnificent 7” stocks experienced double-digit losses. By contrast, emerging markets were supported by gains in Chinese equities and, notably, a rally in Indian equities. The latter benefitted from improved economic data and expectations of a rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India in April. In fixed income, the Bloomberg Global Aggregate Bond Index rose by 0.6% in March. Commodities also performed strongly, with IGF’s positions in gold, silver, and crude oil generating gains in excess of 5% for the month.
 Looking ahead, we anticipate continued market volatility amid ongoing trade-related uncertainties. We remind investors that IGF has a long-term horizon and that such volatility may present attractive entry points for long-term investors.
 The IGF team remains available to address any queries.
