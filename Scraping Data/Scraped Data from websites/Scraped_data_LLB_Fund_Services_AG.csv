2024: Lipper Award for LLB – one of the world's most trustworthy banks
We are proud to announce that LLB has once again been honoured by Lipper for its outstanding investment solutions. The renowned Lipper Fund Awards named us the leading Overall Manager in the category of Small Asset Managers in Germany. This accolade is a testament to the excellent performance we have achieved with at least three equity, bond and strategy funds over the past three years. For our investors, the award is further proof that LLB is justifiably considered one of the world's most trustworthy banks.
2022: LLB among the best sustainable asset managers
The LLB once again achieved an excellent ranking in asset management in the independent comparative test conducted by the Fuchsbriefe publishing house.
We successfully put our sustainable asset management strategy Balanced (EUR) into the ""race"". The performance test started in 2020 and will continue until the end of 2024.
In so-called performance projects, Fuchsbriefe-Verlag investigates the quality of the respective asset management institution. The current Performance Project VI focuses on standardised asset management with funds. The concrete test case with complex conditions is described on www.fuchsbriefe.de. The publisher sees itself in the role of a testing authority with specific client needs. Currently, 38 competitors are tested against the benchmark.
2021: German and Austrian Fund Award 2021
Systematic investment expertise leads to sustainable added value
LLB Emerging Markets Bonds (EUR) received the top rating of ""Outstanding"" in the emerging markets bond fund category at the German and Austrian Fund Awards presented by the publication FONDS professionell.

The award is based on a quantitative evaluation of the eleven most important fund categories. In a further step, the top funds were then scrutinized in a multi stage process. This involved analyzing not only whether the fund had consistently moved within the bandwidths of its investment universe, but also whether the results achieved were actually attributable to the correct decisions made by management. The three best funds in each category were awarded ""Outstanding.

This impressively demonstrates that the management approach of LLB Emerging Markets Bonds (EUR) with its tactical risk control delivers an attractive risk/return profile over the long term, which is also convincing in a comparison of competitors.

Private label funds
Private label funds are an efficient and sustainable way to structure your assets. They particularly excel in terms of flexibility, security, transparency and investor protection. These are qualities that are becoming increasingly important in an ever more complex world. Find out more about the advantages of private label funds below.
More
Quick and tailored to your private label fund – the advantages
Bespoke design and flexibility
Your private label fund bears the name of your choice (label). The investment policy and the fee structure of your private label fund are designed according to your needs. This provides you with a tailored investment solution.
Security and transparency
The segregation of assets as well as the audited net asset value calculations and the audited annual reports guarantee a high level of security and transparency for investors and your clients.
Visibility and distribution benefits
Your private label fund can be promoted as a financial product. This allows you to increase your visibility to the outside world.
Increased efficiency
You can manage the assets of several clients through your private label fund. This reduces costs for you and your investors, and increases efficiency. This leaves you with more time for portfolio management, client support and sales.
Tax benefits
Your private label fund is attractive in terms of taxes for your clients and investors. The fund itself is not a tax entity, which offers a number of advantages compared to asset management at the custody account level.
Outsourcing/delegation options
As an external asset manager, you can transfer your regulatory obligations to us and benefit from the outsourcing and delegation options.

Reclaim withholding taxes – optimise your after-tax return with us
To the extent it makes economic sense and is allowed by law, we reclaim your recoverable portion of withholding taxes on dividends and interest payments. To help you with this complicated process, make use of the extended services of the LLB and the LLB Group.

Reclaim withholding tax on investment income PDF
In most countries, income such as interest and dividends is subject to a withholding tax (Switzerland: anticipatory tax), which is deducted directly from your income. If a double taxation agreement (DTA) exists between your tax domicile and the issuing country and if you are eligible under that agreement, the withholding tax can be reclaimed in whole or at least in part.
Once you grant us power of attorney to do so, we can take care of the entire process of reclaiming withholding taxes for you.
Our services
Ongoing monitoring of the double taxation agreements in force
Filling out applications
All correspondence with involved offices and agencies
Monitoring of incoming payments
Crediting of recovered amounts
Your benefits
The bank's specialists take care of and monitor the time-consuming and complicated process.
No additional effort is required on your part.
You benefit from higher performance thanks to recovered, previously unused withholding tax amounts.

Attractive performance – the Liechtenstein fund centre
The Principality of Liechtenstein proves it time and again – investors benefit from the agile and modern fund centre in the heart of Europe. Simplified access to the European markets, rapid fund launches and time to market are the crucial factors. Thanks to its membership in the European Economic Area (EEA), Liechtenstein has an EU-compliant fund law, and both investors and management companies have access to the European market and EU-compliant funds.
Time to market is a deciding factor for fund promoters when considering a fund location. The legally mandated periods for authorising standard products are short.
Attractive conditions
The Liechtenstein fund location benefits from a stable financial centre with a high-performance banking system and moderate taxation. The assets managed by Liechtenstein funds are tax-exempt. Liechtenstein is considered a part of Switzerland for the purposes of the Swiss stamp tax law, so that Liechtenstein funds are exempt from the securities transfer tax. Payments from funds are also not subject to value added tax.
Advantages of the Liechtenstein fund location
Transparent, fully supervised fund location
Simplified procedure for obtaining European passports for fund products and management companies
Quick authorisation procedures for standard products with legally mandated maximum processing periods
Wide range of legal structures available for funds
Low-cost compliance with legal publication obligations using electronic platforms
Simple and EU-compliant design of fund prospectuses
Individualised asset management and investment advice through competent management companies
Exemption from the issue tax when buying funds
Regional, economic, and cultural proximity to Switzerland

Our investment process for your success
Our investment style for equities and bonds is active and value-oriented. 
In equities, we rely on a proven, independent multi-factor approach. The quantitative ranking of the securities serves the fund manager as a starting point for further fundamental analysis. For an optimal risk / return structure, we use a top-down approach. Our experts look at global economic trends, continue to search for the best sectors and regions, and finally select the most promising individual stocks in this segment.

Set up your own fund
Setting up your own fund is equally attractive whether you're a private or an institutional investor. The opportunity to jointly invest assets and at the same time have them managed professionally in a portfolio is a special combination with many advantages.
The advantages of your private label fund
The fund can be tailored to your needs
You choose the labelling yourself
Investment decisions are made by you or, if you wish, your business partners. We assist you with advice as you see fit.
The investment policy, fee structure, and other parameters carry your personal touch.
LLB Fund Services AG takes over the formation and administration of your fund. This gives you more time to take care of your clients and focus on what's important.
Set up a fund with us that suits your needs
Whether you have already planned every last detail of your private label fund or have a clear vision of what you want: We will help you set up your fund from the very start.
Initial consultation and analysis
Based on your needs and your investment idea, we will jointly define the right structure, the name of the fund, and the pricing.
Investment policy
Your fund idea is unique. So that it distinguishes itself successfully from your competitors, a wide range of topics and niches are available to you. We use these purposefully to jointly define the investment policy.
Realisation
We prepare the fund prospectuses and all necessary contracts. We also submit the licence application for your fund to the Financial Market Authority (FMA) Liechtenstein and take care of registration in selected distribution countries.
Coordination
During the entire process of setting up the fund, we harmonise the work processes of all involved parties. This ensures optimal coordination of the depositary, the fund management, and the fund administration.
Launch
Once the licence has been issued by the Financial Market Authority Liechtenstein, nothing stands in the way of introducing your private label fund on the market. You are responsible for distribution and marketing. We take care of important compliance tasks.
The launch of your private label fund
Clear legal rules and expeditious cooperation with the Liechtenstein authorities make it possible to launch your private label fund quickly. In particular, we are in close contact with the Financial Market Authority (FMA) Liechtenstein. The FMA is independent, set up according to private sector principles, and client-oriented. It distinguishes itself by its outstanding quality and pragmatic solutions.
Time to market – in theory and practice
LLB Fund Services AG attaches great importance to the time-to-market approach not only on paper, but also in daily business. The legally mandated processing times of the Financial Market Authority (FMA) Liechtenstein also distinguish the Liechtenstein fund centre positively from its international competitors.
Milestones & duration
Advice / conception: 3 weeks
Preparation of documents and contracts: 1 week

Make it easier to deal with your personal tax documentation
Depending upon your tax domicile, your investment schemes may be subject to different rules or different tax documentation requirements. We work with the appropriate tax reports in order to make your documentation more straightforward and understandable for you.
Downloads
Client reports PDF
Tax information Switzerland (available in German only) PDF
Tax information Germany (available in German only) PDF
Tax information Austria (available in German only) PDF
Drawing up tax documentation is normally a complex matter and, depending upon tax domicile, can be subject to specific requirements. In order to enable you to comply with your tax disclosure requirements in your particular tax domicile in a convenient and reliable manner, we offer you the appropriate tax reports along with transparent client reports. These will make it easier for you, amongst other things, to complete your tax return. Please note that we always need to receive your request for client reports by 9 January of the following year.
e-tax statement for Switzerland
The e-tax statement for Switzerland is the optimal solution for natural persons domiciled in Switzerland. In it we provide a clear listing of tax-relevant investment income and assets as well as of the withholding tax on your accounts and custody accounts in accordance with Swiss tax legislation. Thanks to the e-tax statement, you can easily import all values digitally into the tax return software for your canton.
Liechtenstein tax report
The Liechtenstein tax report contains all asset values required for the tax return as at 1 January of the respective tax year. You can carry over the values indicated into your tax return and file the tax report as an enclosure to your tax return.
Tax report for Germany
The tax report for Germany is intended for private individuals with tax domicile in Germany. It provides a clear record of all investment income relevant for tax purposes as well as sale transactions and withholding tax relating to your accounts and custody accounts. The figures can be transferred directly from our templates into the KAP (capital assets), KAP-INV (capital assets – investment income) and SO (other income) sections of your income tax declaration.
Tax reports for Austria, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands
The tax reports for Austria, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands are intended for private individuals with tax domicile in those countries. They contain all investment income relevant for tax purposes as well as sale transactions and withholding tax relating to your accounts and custody accounts according to the relevant applicable tax law. The automatic fill-in aid makes it even easier to complete your income tax return.
Additional information for Spain: disclosure of foreign assets (Modelo 720 Spain)
Persons resident in Spain are obliged to provide comprehensive information to the Spanish tax authorities concerning any banking assets held by them abroad above a particular value threshold. Our form 720 contains all information relevant for completing the electronic 720 disclosure, which must be submitted separately from the Spanish tax return.
UK tax report
The UK tax report is intended for private individuals with tax domicile in the United Kingdom (UK). It provides a clear record of the investment income relevant for tax purposes as well as sale transactions and withholding tax relating to your accounts and custody accounts according to the applicable tax law (period: 6 April until 5 April of the following year). Thanks to the automatic fill-in aid, our tax report makes it even easier to complete your income tax return.
General client report
The general client report is intended for clients with tax domiciles in other countries as well as for legal persons. This client report presents your income and expenses along with your gains and losses from sale transactions calculated according to the ""FiFo"" method (first-in-first-out) (period: calendar year).
