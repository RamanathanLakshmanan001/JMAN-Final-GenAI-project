Services » Insurance Bond
Since July 2009, all Irish company must have a Director who is resident in the E.E.A. If a company cannot arrange a Director who is resident in the E.E.A the legal alternative is the insurance bond. The purpose of the Bond is to ensure that the company will file the required annual compliance documents at the companies registry and the tax authorities. If the company fails to meet its statutory requirements, then either of theses bodies are entitled to call upon the bond issuer to pay the outstanding fees, fines, taxes up to a maximum of €25,000    
We can arrange the above bond for you. The cost is €1875.00 for a two year bond..
The type of bond available is a ""recourse"" bond. If the company fails to carry out its statutory filings at the Companies Registry or the Tax Authorities, then the insurance company is entitled to pursue the company and /or its Directors for their loss.

Services » MISSED A/R - DISTRICT COURT APPLICATION
When applying to the District Court for an extension of time to file a missed return without losing audit exemption, it is necessary to state the circumstances of why the annual return was missed.  This is done by way of an affadavit that the judge will read.  Nobody connected to the company will be required to attend court.  We will look after the legal representations there.
Companies whos registered office is situated outside of Dublin must change their registered office to Dublin while the court application is taking place and will be returned to the original address after the court hearing.
The company will need a viable excuse as to why the annual return was missed. To say one forgot would not succeed in court.
All-in cost for the hearing and follow up documentation is €750.00 plus VAT this includes court fees, legal fees, agents fees etc.  We will refund your payment if unsuccessful in court.  Payment will be required upfront as the district court office requires payment accordingly.
Please print this page off, complete below and scan back to us at:  wcurrco@gmail.com
It should be noted that it is a criminal offence not to do annual return filings at Companies Registration Office with fines of up to €5,000.00 per missed return.

Every company is required to have a company seal.  It is the signature of the company.  An impression of the seal should only be put on important documents like contracts, mortgages and other binding or legal documents.  The impression of the seal on documents must be witnessed by a director and secretary of the company or two directors or any other persons approved by the Board of Directors.

Please see information leaflet 
Legalisation of Documents
If doing business in jurisdications outside of Ireland, Foreign Agents or Government Authorities may require various documents to be certified by a Solicitor or Notary Public and then to have their signature verified by the Dept of Foreign Affairs.  This procedure is known as an apostile.  There are two types of apostiles,, convention and non-convention, i.e. those who signed up to the 1976 Convention recognising the Certificate of Documents by Government Authorities and those who did not.
We charge €200.00 plus VAT for arranging same.  
Acting as Company Secretary
We only act as Secretary to one director companies as we would not be in a position to travel around the county to attend director meetings.
A secretary is an officer of a company just as a director is.  The secretary has obligations under the Companies Act 2014 and under Anti-Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Acts.  In this regard we need to know who are the beneficial owners of a company (persons holding more than 25% issued share in a company)
Being an officer of a company we need to know the activity of the company and whatever other details we may be deemed as appropriate.  We will, from time to time, request a copyof a bank statement to confirm our knowledge and understanding of the companies business.  (The customer may black out account number, Iban etc for security reasons)
If you wish to engage us as secretary for your company we will take it that you understand and agree to our policy of ""know your customer""
Our cost to arrange secretary is €450.00 plus VAT per annum
Business Names
A person or a Limited Company may register a business name under which they intend to trade.  It is unlawful to carry on business under any title other than your own name without registered that name at the Companies Registration Office.  
A business name registration gives you no protection to that name at the Companies Registration Office who will allow another business name or Limited Company to be subsequently registered by somebody else using your title.  It is best to incorporate a Limited Company to protect your title and protect yourself personally against various lawsuits.
Cost of business name registration is €100.00 plus VAT and usually registration takes approx 2 weeks
Tax Registration
Once your company is registered you should apply online for the company to be registered for Corporation Tax, PAYE and VAT.  It is one form, TR2. for all tax registration.  Whereas it is necessary to register for Corporation Tax and PAYE, it is not compulsory to register for VAT unless your business exceeds €70,000 for the supply of goods and €38,000 for the supply of services.  However if  you don't register then most good and services you buy will have VAT on them which will be lost to you whereas if you are registered you will reclaim VAT charged from Revenue.
To explain how VAT works is as follows:
When you charge VAT on your invoice, the VAT amount should be put into an imaginary box and when you pay a bill with VAT on it you take that amount out of the box.  At the end of the VAT period which is usually every two months, what is left in the box belongs to Revenue and needs to be sent to them.
There are two methods of accounting for VAT.  One is based on invoices sent out and the other is based on receipt of payments from clients.
Beneficial Owners Registration (RBO)
The owners of 25% or more of shares of any company are obligated to register their details at the Registry of Beneficial Owners (RBO).  Their website is www.rbo.gov.ie  Registration at the RBO must be completed within 5 months of one becoming a beneficial owner.  Failure to company may lead to penalties.
We charge €100.00 plus VAT for one person.  If there are two more more we charge €75.00 plus VAT per person.
High Court Restoration
If a company is dissovled more than one year it can only be restored through the Courts.  In most instances this requires a High Court Order but in some circumstances it could be Circuit Court.  Our fees remain the same.
We charge €5500.00 plus VAT and this includes all court and associated fees: Barrister, Solicitor, Chief State Solicitor, Revenue Solicitor, Companies Office Solicitor, outlays and follow up work to completion.
The Company must have all its Revenue and Companies Office filings up-to-date before either of these Authorities will give their written Letter of No Objection to the restoration.
Companies are usually dissolved due to non-filings at CRO.  Late filing penalites will then apply.  Penalties are €1,200 for each return more than a year outstanding.  There is a maximum late penalty of €3,600 for all annual returns.  In addition to penalties, there is a charge of €20.00 per each return.
Should the High Court Application be adjourned due to the failure of the client to finalise their end of affairs, there will be an extra charge of €400.00 plus VAT for the solicitor to go to court and seek an adjournment.
High Court Restoration takes 3/4 months approx
