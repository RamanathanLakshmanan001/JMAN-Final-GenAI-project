INFORMATION ON REPORTING UNDER THE WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION ACT
On the basis of Act No. 171/2023 Coll., on the protection of whistleblowers (hereinafter referred to as the ""Act""), inflow s.r.o., ID: 066 31 363, with its registered office at Bucharova 2657/12, Stodůlky, 158 00 Prague 5 (hereinafter referred to as the “Company“), has established an internal whistleblowing system for natural persons who, in connection with their work or other similar activities, become aware of possible infringements that violate legal regulations falling within one of the areas defined by the Act.
I. Relevant Person
The relevant person to receive reports is Mrs Elena Mocrousova, tel. +420 605 181 842.
II. Eligibility of reports
The relevant person and the Company will also deal with notifications submitted anonymously by the whistleblower.
III. Submission of a report
The whistleblower may submit a report through the internal notification system established by the Company orally, in writing or in person to the relevant person. A whistleblower who intends to submit a report in writing may also do so by:
a.
sending a postal item through a postal service provider to the hands of the relevant person at the following address: Mrs Elena Mocrousova, Hůrky 11, 378 33 Nová Bystřice, whereby the envelope should be marked ""DO NOT OPEN – CONFIDENTIAL"", or
b.
inserting a report in a box set up for this purpose by inflow at its headquarters, marked with its logo and the title ""WHISTLEBLOWING"".
A whistleblower who intends to submit a report in person will be allowed to do so no later than 14 days after requesting the relevant person to submit it in person. The whistleblower may use one of the above communication channels for this purpose.
IV. Reportable actions
Only conduct that meets the following criteria can be reported under the Act:
a.
has the elements of a crime, or
b.
has the characteristics of an offence for which the law provides for a fine of at least CZK 100,000, or
c.
violates the Act, or
d.
violates any other law or regulation of the European Union in the field of: financial services, statutory audit and other verification services, financial products and financial markets, corporate income tax, prevention of money laundering and terrorism financing, consumer protection, compliance with product requirements including product safety, transport and road safety, environmental protection, food and feed safety and the protection of animals and their health, radiation protection and nuclear safety, competition, public auctions and public procurement, the protection of internal order and security, life and health, the protection of personal data, privacy and security of electronic communications networks and information systems, the protection of the financial interests of the European Union, or the functioning of the internal market, including the protection of competition and state aid under European Union law.
V. Other ways to submit a report
In addition to the internal whistleblowing system, whistleblowers also have the option of submitting a report through an external whistleblowing system operated by the Ministry of Justice. This is not the case with regard to the report of violation of Act No. 253/2008 Coll., on the Selected Measures against Legitimisation of Proceeds of Crime and Financing of Terrorism, which are submitted to the Financial Analytical Office instead of the Ministry of Justice. Such submissions can be made in person, by telephone or in writing, and also via a secure form on the following website: https://oznamovatel.justice.cz/chci-podat-oznameni/. More information on reporting, whistleblower protection etc. is available at: https://oznamovatel.justice.cz/informace-pro-oznamovatele/."
