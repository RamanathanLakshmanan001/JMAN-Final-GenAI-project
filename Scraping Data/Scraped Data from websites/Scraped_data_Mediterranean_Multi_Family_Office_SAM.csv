How is it to live in Switzerland
Why relocate to Switzerland?
When you consider to relocate to another country, many questions come up of course!
How is the life in Switzerland? Can I just move to Switzerland? Etc, etc. With this information site, we will try to answer (shortly) your questions.
But the best way is to take a meeting with us - maybe on Zoom, Teams, Skype, phone or similar - to get answers on your questions.
You can call us at +33 64 06 16 500 or email us at info@mmfo.eu
But why relocate to Switzerland, was the first question?
People and families are of course very different.
But what we have heard during many years of experience is, that the most important reasons, why clients move to Switzerland, is:
High class of security - low criminality
Switzerland is extremely well organized and efficient
Not bureaucratic
Very acceptable or low taxes
Amazing nature (mountains, lakes, skiing, seasport etc)
One of the richest countries in the world
One of the world best health systems
Extremely high decentralizations to the 26 different cantons
Healthy climate - fresh air
High class life values
Stable political system
Switzerland is in the middle of Europe
One of the worlds best schools and universities
Many UHNW from UK choose Switzerland because of the Brexit
Why do millionaires and billionaires relocate to Switzerland?
Most millionaires and billionaires first priority are to live in a secure country with very low criminality, stable political system and good infrastructure.
to this come reasonable tax system or low tax and well organized, efficient public system. But for most of these UHNW individuals, the nature and social life has to be high end class as well.
In our experience during many years, it seems that Switzerland fulfills most people´s dreams regarding these wishes.
Why purchase a Swiss property?
Most wealthy individuals choose to purchase a home when they have decided, where they will live in Switzerland.
The prices for properties in Switzerland have always been very stable and for the moment they increase by 2 reasons. One is that many foreign people relocate to Switzerland.
And the other reason is, that it has been very popular for people living in Switzerland to invest in properties thanks to the negative interests in banks.
Can I buy a Swiss property, if I am not resident in Switzerland?
Many people fall in love in a second home in Switzerland for example a chalet, ski apartment etc.
But can I purchase a second home in Switzerland, if I am not resident in Switzerland?
If the property´s status is a summer house, it should be possible. But if not you need to get a permission.
As we know, there are 26 different cantons in Switzerland, and there are different rules from canton to canton.
But if you have any wishes, we can help you to find out, if it is possible or not.
Don´t hesitate to call us at +33 64 06 16 500 or email us at info@mmfo.eu.
SCHOOLS IN SWITZERLAND
Many UHNW individuals with children, actually moves to Switzerland because they want their child/children to have one of the best educations in the world. We can help you.
KINDERGARDENS IN SWITZERLAND
In most countries of Europe, kindergardens are okay. But in Switzerland the safety is one of the highest priority, why UHNW appreciate to have their children in kindergarten here.
The service is in top, flexibility is in top, and you always feel very welcome.
UNIVERSITIES IN SWITZERLAND
Many parents move to Switzerland to give their children one of the best university education in the world. There are a high level of discipline and most students have ambitions, which means it is a perfect place to study, if you really want to progress
and have good results.
SPORTS IN SWITZERLAND
In Switzerland you can enjoy all type of sport. Ski sport is of course a favorite for many people living here, but also watersport thanks to the many lakes.
Tax in Switzerland
There are 26 different cantons in Switzerland, and the taxes are very different from canton to canton.
But in general you have 2 different tax systems in Switzerland.
You have of course a normal taxation system for personal income, capital gains on shares, bonds etc, dividends, interests, capital gains on real estate etc.
But some people can qualify to a special tax system called ""pauschalbesteurung"" - or lump sum taxation.
If you want to be covered by this system, you are not allowed to work in Switzerland.
No matter how high your income is, you will only be taxed by the value of 7 times your rental of your home (or a calculated rental if you own your home yourself).
It is just increased to 7 times from 5 times before.
That is the main procedure of this tax regime, but in many cases it is a negotiation between you and the local tax authorizations.
In short term we can say, that you can have a very low tax rates in Switzerland compared to many other countries.
How to relocate to Switzerland?
if you want to relocate to Switzerland, we can help you.
But we need to know many things regarding your family situation, economy, whishes and needs before we can choose the right plan.
Citizens of Schengen countries can move to Switzerland without a visa but have to apply for a residence permit for stays exceeding three months.
There are no restrictions on how many EU/EFTA/Schengen citizens can immigrate to Switzerland and obtain a residence permit annually
Give us a call at +33 64 06 16 500 or email us at info@mmfo.eu
Resident card
When you move to Switzerland you have to apply for a residence permit. If you come from a Schengen country, you don't need a visa.
Health insurance in Switzerland
You need to have a health insurance when you relocate to Switzerland. There are many Swiss insurance companies offering this. But there are foreign companies doing the same as well.
We can guide you to a professional broker.
How to open a bank account in Switzerland
Like all other places it is important to have a bank in the country where you live.
But which bank, you should choose, depend of your needs and wishes. There can be very huge differences in service and prices for the products.
We can guide you, but we need to make an analyse of your needs.
Call us at +33 64 06 16 500 or email us at info@mmfo.eu.

Advisor in the purchase of real estate
Over the years many buyers have used us for our experience when they are going to purchase a property, and most properties were purchased at interesting prices.
We can be your advisor without any costs (call us and we will explain how).
How to purchase a French, Monegasque, Swiss, Italian or Spanish property the best way?
You don't ave to contact a lot of agencies. Tell us your wishes and needs, and we will find a selection of properties matching this.
An agent looks into their own portfolio, but we look into the whole market.
As we have extensive experience in dealing with properties in many countries, we are able to advice you on matters in a much more efficient way than the local agents,
whose knowledge is very often limited to their own market only.
We ensure that both buyer and seller are bound by their decision faster than normal, and this makes the seller more open to negotiation,
as they do not want a long drawn-out process. Our checks and clauses ensure, that the parties are committed to the purchase early.
Many buyers are foreigners, so they are not necessarily familiar with the rules, legal and practical matters etc, and the law can be very different compare to other countries.
With our background we prepare you in all matters.
Helle Skovby is educated as a real estate broker in Denmark.
It takes many years compared to in the south of Europe, where you can be educated very quickly.
We have a deep knowledge in legal and practical matters in real estate trading down here with more than 20 years of experience.
Michael Skovby Nielsen has more than 25 years of experience in international property deals, financial matters and cross border tax
and financial matters and have made several books regarding this, including 2 with Deloitte and 1 with KPMG.
Many buyers use us as their advisor with the following benefits,
to name a few:
Our international knowledge means that the sellers see us as attractive buyers
Therefore, we can often acquire properties at great prices and conditions
The buyer is advised on tax-, inheritance, financial matters etc, and we cooperate with specialist as well
Our local knowledge helps avoid mistakes, and we help the buyer until the end
The agents must only take care of the seller's interest and not the buyer's
We only take care of the buyer's interest in these cases and look into the hole market
The buyer only speaks with one advisor
The buyer will therefore not be disturbed by a lot of agents
If you are in the market for buying a French, Monegasque, Swiss, Italian or Spanish property, we analyze your wishes and needs
and come up with a concrete purchase strategy, tax plan and a plan for which form the purchase of the property should take
(all depending on your family situation etc.).
The difference between a buyer finding a property himself
or using us as his advisor, can be illustrated as follows:
The buyer finds the property himself
The buyer uses us as his advisor to find the best property:

How is it to live in France
Most people who have visited France like the country especially The French Riviera.
Many think it could be wonderful to move to France.
But how is daily life in France/The French Riviera?
Why France? Is it good to live at the Riviera?
Most people would agree that France is beautiful, but The French Riviera is amazing.
The nature is fantastic with the mountains, the greenery and the Mediterranean Sea and not to forget the beaches.
At the Riviera you will also find a lot of picturesque medieval villages with beautiful, old town houses, cozy squares, fountains, cozy restaurants, cafés, galleries, shops etc.
To mention but a few you have Saint Paul de Vence, Mougins, Villefranche sur Mer, Eze Village, Roquebrune Village, Le Haut Val de Cagnes etc..
The Riviera offers of course bigger cities, whereof Nice is the biggest and then comes Cannes and Antibes.
Some like to live near the beach and others prefer the back country.
Thanks to the mountains you can have sea view from many places at the back country too.
The weather in the South of France is also one of the main reasons, why people decide to live there.
The sun is shining nearly every day, but thanks to a little rain now and then, we have the greenery, flowers etc.
One other wonderful reason to live at the Riviera is the food, which is wonderful most places.
The Mediterranean food is amazing and healthy with a lot of fish, vegetables etc, and we love it.
But you can find everything so it is just a matter of taste, what you prefer. For many people in France the wine is a big part of the life.
Everyone knows, that France produces fantastic wine in all ranges as well as the neighbor country Italy.
We must say, that living in South of France is just to enjoy the life with the sun, the nature, the food and the wine.
At the Riviera you will find all categories of sport, and it´s an area, where there are extremely many golf courts.
The Riviera also offers a lot of festivals, exhibitions, congresses etc. It offers also a lot of glamour and lifestyle.
The life in France is more relaxed than many other places.
People are enjoying life, food and wine, and stress is not very popular here!
That also means, that you can´t necessary expect, that a French person will be on time for an appointment. But you learn to deal with it.
The Riviera is also interesting for another reason, and that is, that many places are so different.
You have the most fashionable places with celebrities, high end shops, restaurants etc. But you have also the opposite and the more relaxed in the middle. .
The same with the nature. You have the soft, green mountains but you also have the raw rocks e.g. the Esterel Mountains west of Cannes and they are so impressive.
And then you also have very flat areas which is beautiful as well.
The cost of living is not expensive but cheaper than many other places.
You can find a very high standard of meat, fish and vegetables.
Nice Airport is the main airport, and it offers many flights to all over the world. But in Mandelieu just outsite Cannes you will also find a smaller airport for private jets etc.
The Riviera offers many harbors for yachts. The biggest is Antibes, but Cannes and La Napoule is huge as well.
How are the French people?
Many says they are snobbish and don´t speak English.
That is not true! In general, French people are extremely polite. But they are very formal. E.g. they don´t only say “Bonjour”.
They say “Bonjour, Monsieur” or “Bonjour, Madame”. If they enter a shop, they always start with “Excusez-Moi” (will you excuse me) before they ask something.
If you ask a French person “do you speak English” they think you are extremely unpolite.
You have to ask in French “Excusez-Moi, parlez vous Englais” (excuse me, do you speak English).
But many French people are perfectionists. That means that if they don´t feel they speak fluently English, they prefer to say they don´t speak English.
But that is not true in most cases, and you will find out that most French people speak English very well.
In a way we say, it is more important to learn to know the French culture, than to learn to speak French.
When this is said, it is of course a good idea to learn the French language even if for most of us is difficult!
It is wonderful to live at the Riviera. You have everything.
But of course you have to find the best area for you depending of your wishes and needs.
You can find very good areas but also the opposite. That´s really important not to take a wrong decision.
When it comes to prices on real estate at the French Riviera in general it has been much more stabile than many other places
thanks to the fact that not many permissions for new buildings are given. In the high end we can say that the most expensive
areas are Cap Ferrat, Cap Martin, Cap d´Ail, Cap d´Antibes etc. They are all amazing areas to the Mediterranean.
Most places are secure, but it is always a good idea to have an alarm and security system.
We have an extremely good local knowledge all over the Riviera during more than 20 years, and you can benefit from our experience.

How is it to live in Monaco
Most people who have visited the French Riviera have been in Monaco and have enjoyed the fascinating atmosphere with the Prince Palace,
Casino Monte Carlo, the Casino Square, the 2 ports etc.
But how is daily life in Monaco?
Why Monaco? Why do many millionaires and billionaires live in Monaco? Is it good to live in Monaco?
For many people the first thought, when they think of Monaco is that it's a place with the richest population and no tax.
But Monaco is much more than that, we can ensure.
One of the best reasons to move to Monaco is, that it is one of the most saftest places in the world!
It is liberating to live in a country, that has a close to zero crime as possible. There are police officers everywhere, and many are civilian.
Most streets are video-surveilled and Monaco has zero tolerance for crime. Everyone feels totally safe in Monaco.
Beside that the population are extremely friendly and actually very helpful-much more than you can expect.
Most residents care about each other and do what they can to help. It makes us feel at home.
Most residents are very open minded. It is normal, that if you have seen someone 3-4 times in the supermarket etc you start to say ""bonjour"".
If you have been to a café or restaurant some few times, the employees will ask ""comment ca va?"" (how are you?).
Monaco is very clean. Every day all streets are cleaned. The population has a high discipline and it is not often you find trash etc on the street.
Monaco is very beautiful and is surrounded by the mountains and the Mediterranean Sea. The weather is very good most of the year, and the sun is shining nearly every day.
It is a very international community, and there are many children and good schools. We have the International School of Monaco and the International University of Monaco as well.
There are a lot of activity for children and young people.
In Monaco you will also find a lot of sport activities in all categories, and there are great fitness centers and many personal coaches as well.
The daily costs for living are not expensive. It is like in France.
But the real estate prices are the highest in the world. The country is very small and there are only 2 possibilities if more apartment is needed.
That is to break down a building and build a higher building or build in the sea.
Because the prices have increased nearly every year the last 40 years in Monaco many investors buy real estate in Monaco as an investment and rent it out on a long-term basis.
Someone says Monaco is like a Disney Land for adults. There are many restaurants, café, night clubs etc.
Many huge activities take place in Monaco. To mention but a few we have Formula 1, the worlds biggest yacht show,
Rallye Monte Carlo, Rolex Masters Tennis, Top Marques and International Jumping every year.
If you like to gamble, there are many Casino´s in Monaco whereof Casino Monte Carlo is the most famous.
When you visit Port Hercule you will find some of the world's most fantastic yachts,
and Monaco also have the very huge and impressive yacht club.
The Port of Fontvieille is big as well and beautiful located below the rock and the Prince Palace.
There are many international associations in Monaco, where you can be member so it is quite easy to meet other people with the same interesses.
It is easy to get to the Airport of Nice. You can go by a helicopter in 10 minutes. But by car or the high way bus it takes only 35 minutes as well.
Monaco has a very good hospital Centre Hopitalier Princesse Grace. Beside that we have IM2S as well plus of course a huge range of doctors, specialists etc.
You are in safe hands in Monaco.
There are about 38.000 inhabitants in Monaco.
How to move to Monaco? Can you just move to Monaco? No, you need to get a Resident Card at the Police. There is a procedure for this.
But before you ask for it, you need two things. You need to find a place to live in Monaco and to open a bank account in Monaco.
You need of course your passport and personal papers (birth certificate, marriage certificate, divorce certificate, clean criminal report etc)
When you have this, you can apply for a Resident Card.
We can help you with everything in this process. Just call us at +33 64 06 16 500 or email us at info@mmfo.eu
We are at your service at phone no. +33 64 06 16 500 or +33 64 39 14 317

Advisor in the sale of real estate
We see the sale of a property as an investment!
One of our main areas is to be advisor in the sale of real estate in France, Monaco, Italy, Switzerland, Spain etc.
How to sell a property in these countries most efficient?
Normally case
When property owners manage the sale themselves most of them put the property on the market with 3-4 brokers, which make sense, but they work in different ways.
They have different descriptions, marketing etc. Often the property is advertised twice or more in the same Magazine due to a lack of coordination between the brokers.
The owner needs to follow up on each agency to be updated on the status of the sale.
Speed up the sales process and save time and worries!
Let us do all the work as your advisor without any further cost (call us and we will explain you how).
We are experts in this kind of management, and when we have visited the property, we define the target group for it. Hereafter we find the right agencies,
who can match the target group, and we screen the agents to find the best once.
We make the marketing plan, property description, select photos etc, and we coordinate, who do what and when.
One of the very important tasks is, that we follow up on each agent, until the property is sold. This has given very good results, because we coach the agents with our international experience.
In the south of Europe things are not always done the same way as anywhere else. E. g. when you sign a purchase agreement some places the owner is bound,
but the buyer has up to 3 months to raise the capital. A lot can happen in 3 months and often buyers change their minds!
We ensure that checks and clauses are in place before signing so we can guarantee a quicker turnaround avoiding the 3 months wait.
We are a Scandinavian team with more than 20 years of experience in property deals on the Riviera etc. Scandinavian business people are known as very efficient and reliable.
We have experience in property deals in many countries (France, Monaco, Denmark, Switzerland, Spain and Germany). Therefor we have seen things be done differently
and much more efficient than in south of Europe. And we use this knowledge, which you can benefit from as the seller.
In our experience, things can take a long time in France, Monaco, Switzerland and Spain, once a buyer has chosen a property, there are still many things, that have to take place
before the sale can go ahead. As your advisor we coordinate a speedy execution of this process, and we ensure that as little time as possible is waisted by the Notary, townhall etc
Sellers using us as their advisor will benefit from the
following, to name but a few:
We define the target group - and find the most trustworthy estate agents and ensure an ongoing evaluation and professional marketing
The buyer is bound faster by the transaction due to our specific clauses that prevent the 3 months waiting time after signing the purchase agreement
We ensure the seller will be advised in tax matters, the legalities etc
We follow up on the estate agents regularly (this has produced great results)
We take care of everything until the end
The owner doesn't have to waste time on any follow up
Our work and advice are free of charge for the owner
The owner will not be disturbed by the brokers
If you are considering selling your French, Monegasque, Swiss, Italian or Spanish property, let us give you a detailed and concrete
presentation of, how we can optimize the sale of it. Call us at (+33) 64 06 16 500 or email us at info@mmfo.eu.
The difference between coordinating the sale yourself
and using us as advisor can be illustrated like this:

Relocation from Norway
Many wealth people are moving from Norway
For many reasons, including the sad economic situation and high taxes for the wealthy, we see that there are many who are considering moving abroad from Norway.
Many of these individuals move to Switzerland or Monaco.
But why relocate from Norway to Switzerland or Monaco?
We have worked for over 20 years in this segment and are impartial advisers when buying and selling property in Monaco, Switzerland, France and Italy.
Helle Skovby is trained as a real estate agent in Denmark, which is a long education compared to e.g. France, Monaco, Switzerland, etc. Michael Skovby Nielsen has worked with properties and tax across national borders for 30 years and has, among other things, written 2 books with Deloitte and 1 with KPMG.
There are many things to be aware of in terms of opportunities and pitfalls, and here our Mediterranean Multi Family Office, Monaco can help, and we are subject to the Financial Supervisory Authority.
We can also help you find the right lawyers, banks, accountants, schools, insurance companies, etc. during a relocation.
Most people more or less think that rules, customs etc. are roughly the same as in one's home country, but this is far from the case. It is important to gain some understanding of the culture in the country in question and to be aware that legislation in various areas may be different from what you are otherwise used to. We have always said that you should move with your heart and not with your treasure.
So it is about finding a country where you think you can have a splendid life, measured by the soft values, and here we see that most people have a splendid life in Monaco and Switzerland.
Why do millionaires and billionaires relocate to Switzerland or Monaco?
We have always said that you should move with your heart and not with your treasure.
So it is about finding a country where you think you can have a splendid life, measured by the soft values, and here we see that most people have a splendid life in Monaco and Switzerland.
Many do not focus enough on the family logistics, and this can end negatively. If one member of the family is not well, no one is well.
Why purchase a property in Switzerland or in Monaco?
But of course, you also have to look at the economy, and here you have to look at the business opportunities if you are still in business and of course taxes on wealth, inheritance, personal income, capital income, living costs etc. But even if the country you choose has attractive taxes, you must also look at whether there are pitfalls.
In some of the 26 cantons in Switzerland, you pay wealth tax. In Monaco there is no wealth tax.
No tax on personal income, capital gains, interest in Monaco?
In Monaco, there is no tax on personal income, capital gains, interest, etc. In Switzerland, tax is paid on personal income, but in many cantons not on capital income. In many places, it is possible to get a lump-sum assessment, where you negotiate with the tax authorities about what you have to pay in tax.
In addition, there may be higher estate taxes in the event of death than you are used to in your home country. The same may apply to gift tax. The fees typically depend on the relationship to the deceased. In the southern countries, there are also typically other inheritance rules that you have to comply with, because here your spouse is not a forced heir, but it is the blood ties that count. In some cases, you can arrange yourself out of it by seeking professional advice. The order of inheritance can be interpreted differently compared to what we are used to.
COST OF LIVING IN SWITZERLAND MONACO
In Switzerland, the cost of living is relatively high. However, VAT is very low in Switzerland at 7.7%.
The cost of living in Monaco is significantly lower than in Scandinavia on e.g. groceries, and there are no taxes on electricity, water, etc.
VAT in Monaco is 20%. In Monaco, there is no registration tax on cars, including no green taxes either.
BYING AND SELLING PROPERTY IN SWITZERLAND AND MONACO
When buying and selling real estate abroad, you can also be surprised if you think things are roughly the same as in your home country.
For example, square meters are not given in the same way as in Scandinavia, and this can make big differences. Trading costs can typically be higher than we are used to.
MUNICIPALITIES RIGHTS IN SWITZERLAND AND MONACO
In some countries, the municipalities have, for example, the right of first refusal, but not in Monaco or Switzerland. In some countries there may be special rights of withdrawal to protect the buyer, but this is not the case in Switzerland and Monaco.
In most countries, it is a notary who corrects the transactions, as in Switzerland and Monaco, but a transaction is not necessarily as efficient as we are used to in Scandinavia. Here we can help speed up the process.
In, for example, the Italian part of Switzerland, mediators and advisers are not as good at coming up with the problems as we are used to, and their culture typically means that they simply solve the problems as they come - instead of analyzing it right from the start.
About buying property in Switzerland and Monaco
When you buy property in Switzerland or Monaco, you must be aware that you are buying it as-is, which is why it is a good idea to ally yourself with a construction expert and thus achieve the same security as the Scandinavian model. Many want to finance part of the purchase, and there are many offers from banks. However, there may be differences between the products.
We have often seen that, for example, it can be expensive to repay a loan early. We had a customer who had to pay DKK 1,000,000 in costs to the bank, but we proposed a technically different solution to the bank, whereby the costs were reduced to DKK 140,000.
About tax on profit in Switzerland and Monaco?
In Switzerland, you have to pay tax on the profit when you sell your property again. In most places, the tax depends on how long you have owned the property.
In Monaco, there is no tax on profit from the property upon sale, nor are there ongoing property taxes. If there is tax on profits from the sale of real estate, you must be aware that this may also apply to the sale of property outside your new home country. Property pricing in Switzerland and Monaco is different than in Scandinavia.
About transferring property to your children
If at some point you wish to transfer the property to, for example, your children, you must be aware that the rules may be very different from those in Scandinavia.
