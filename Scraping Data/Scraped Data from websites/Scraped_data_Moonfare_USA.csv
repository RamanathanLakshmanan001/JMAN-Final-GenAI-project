Important information
Moonfare does not make investment recommendations and no communication, through this website or in any other medium should be construed as a recommendation for any security offered on or off this investment platform. Alternative investments in private placements, and private equity investments via feeder funds in particular, are speculative and involve a high degree of risk and those investors who cannot afford to lose their entire investment should not invest. Prospective investors should carefully consider the risk warnings and disclosures for the respective fund or investment vehicle set out therein. The value of an investment may go down as well as up and investors may not get back their money originally invested. Past performance is not necessarily a guide to future performance. An investment in a fund or investment vehicle is not the same as a deposit with a banking institution. Please refer to the respective fund documentation for details about potential risks, charges and expenses. Additionally, investors will typically receive illiquid and/or restricted membership interests that may be subject to holding period requirements and/or liquidity concerns. In the most sensible investment strategy for private equity investing, private equity should only be part of your overall investment portfolio. Further, the private equity portion of your portfolio may include a balanced portfolio of different private equity funds. Investments in private equity are highly illiquid and those investors who cannot hold an investment for the long term (at least 10 years) should not invest.

Leverage our global PE network to access exclusive deals
Moonfare maintains close relationships with over 250 top-tier fund managers which enables us to curate a selection of high-quality co-investment deals rarely available elsewhere.
Lower fees than traditional private equity
Moonfare sources co-investment deals from GPs on a lower fee- and 
carried interest-basis, improving IRR potential and providing an opportunity for a shorter time to net positive cash flow.
Potentially higher returns
Co-investment funds usually have a shorter capital deployment phase and can outperform traditional PE funds in the long term due to a reduced fee structure and the growth potential of underlying companies¹.

Explore the potential of private equity secondaries.
Moonfare’s proprietary strategy on secondaries offers access to a well-rounded portfolio of secondary private equity investments, tailored for those seeking diversification and potentially more consistent returns.
Invest alongside experts
With extensive secondaries experience and access to high-quality fund managers, our team only targets the best deals.
Immediate diversification
Invest in a multitude of underlying companies across different geographies, sectors and vintages.
Faster distributions
Secondaries funds invest later in an asset’s life cycle, resulting in potentially faster distributions than traditional private equity.
Our unique approach to secondaries
Our secondaries strategy seeks to generate lower risk, shorter duration returns compared to traditional private equity, while capitalising on our long-standing relationships with top-tier fund managers.
Deal type
Balance of diverse secondary LP portfolios and GP-led continuation vehicles.
Geography
Global exposure with a focus on North America and Europe.
Underlying investment type
Emphasis on buyouts with exposure to a range of other asset classes.
Secondaries in action: Project Athena
Learn how Moonfare’s secondaries strategy works in practice through a real-world example.
The company
US-based ""Athena"" helps thousands of the world's leading brands better understand their consumers so they can unlock business growth and outpace the competition.
Why we like it
""Athena"" became a market leader through superior technology, advanced analytics and cross-industry data. It has a diverse customer base, resulting in low churn and high revenue retention.
The Deal
Structured as a GP-led secondary transaction, Moonfare invested in the single asset continuation vehicle managed by a leading U.S. middle-market private equity firm.
Moonfare’s Edge
We sourced the deal through existing relationships with top-tier intermediaries who coordinated the transaction, while tapping into our network to inform the investment process.
Matching secondaries with the flexibility of a semi-liquid, open-ended fund.
Our secondaries strategy combines simplicity with diversified exposure, all through a single ticket.2
Easier to manage
Commitments are paid upfront, and investors don’t have to keep track of multiple capital calls and distribution notices.
Compounding effect
Secondaries returns have the potential to be reinvested sooner in a semi-liquid, open-ended fund, which could lead to greater compounded growth.
Inherent liquidity
Semi-liquid, open-ended funds may provide investors with greater liquidity compared to traditional closed-end funds.3
2 Liquidity is not guaranteed.
3 Redemptions are not guaranteed, may not be eligible to all investors and are subject to demand and to Board approval.

Moonfare does not make investment recommendations and no communication, through this website or in any other medium should be construed as a recommendation for any security offered on or off this investment platform. Alternative investments in private placements, and private equity investments via feeder funds in particular, are speculative and involve a high degree of risk and those investors who cannot afford to lose their entire investment should not invest. Prospective investors should carefully consider the risk warnings and disclosures for the respective fund or investment vehicle set out therein. The value of an investment may go down as well as up and investors may not get back their money originally invested. Past performance is not necessarily a guide to future performance. An investment in a fund or investment vehicle is not the same as a deposit with a banking institution. Please refer to the respective fund documentation for details about potential risks, charges and expenses. Additionally, investors will typically receive illiquid and/or restricted membership interests that may be subject to holding period requirements and/or liquidity concerns. In the most sensible investment strategy for private equity investing, private equity should only be part of your overall investment portfolio. Further, the private equity portion of your portfolio may include a balanced portfolio of different private equity funds. Investments in private equity are highly illiquid and those investors who cannot hold an investment for the long term (at least 10 years) should not invest.

Digital Private Equity Manager Moonfare Launches in Australia
Share this post:
Fast-growing digital private equity manager Moonfare has further expanded its international operations by opening for business in Australia.
Since its establishment in 2016, Moonfare has become a leading provider of private equity investments in Europe, North America and Asia-Pacific. Now, eligible1 Australian investors can also benefit from access to carefully curated funds from top-tier private equity managers such as KKR, EQT and the Carlyle Group at low minimums, with direct investments and Moonfare proprietary strategies also available.
“There is clearly a growing appetite for private equity investing in Australia. But so far access has been limited, especially for people wanting exposure to non-domestic managers and strategies. Moonfare’s digital private equity platform plans to fill that gap by providing seamless access to globally leading top-quartile managers,” said Steffen Pauls, Moonfare’s Founder and co-Chief Executive. 
Australia’s private wealth market is growing. The country has the highest proportion of private wealth investors across the APAC region, with high-net worth assets under management standing at over USD $1 trillion2,3; it has the fifth largest average wealth globally4. Australian investors are also increasingly interested in investing in alternatives, but some reports suggest they want better education and market access5, both of which Moonfare was established to deliver.
Moonfare’s proprietary portfolio investments provide instant diversification across a range of strategies at low minimums, including buyout, growth equity, venture and infrastructure. Investments in secondaries, private credit and co-investments are also available, while family offices and those able to invest at larger scale can invest directly in select companies alongside leading general partners (GPs).
Moonfare investors also benefit from access to a unique secondary market platform with institutional participation by Lexington Partners*. This comprises a twice-yearly auction for investors wanting to sell existing stakes in Moonfare’s funds, or acquire new ones.
Moonfare has established itself as a leading platform bringing the benefits of private equity to a broader audience. It now has over €3.3 billion in assets under management and almost 5,000 investors. More than 71,000 family offices, industrial families and private investors have now registered as part of its investment community. With the addition of Australia, the Moonfare platform is now available in 23 countries.
“Our APAC investor relations team is in active discussions with potential clients in Australia,” said Adam Banks, Moonfare’s Head of Asia Pacific. “We look forward to bringing the Moonfare experience to many more eligible investors as we expand our presence in the region.”

Invest directly in Flagship Funds.
Tap into the power of investing in specific private equity funds. With our Flagship Funds, you can handpick individual opportunities aligned with your strategy, providing greater control and transparency.
Why choose Flagship Funds?
Access
Historically, private equity fund investments were out of reach for everyone except for institutional investors, family offices and the ultra-wealthy. Moonfare levelled the playing field — enabling qualified investors to access this asset class.
Outperformance
Benefit from what so many institutional investors already know: private markets may lead to better returns. Top quartile funds, like the ones we aim to offer on Moonfare, have generated an average IRR of 24 percent since 2005 - outperforming the S&P 500 by 16 percentage points.¹
Growing asset class
The private capital industry reached $11.7 trillion as of June 30, 2022. AUM has now grown at an annual rate of nearly 20 percent since 2017.² When investors tap into private equity, they gain access to a rapidly-growing asset class that reaches beyond the public markets.
Capital Calls and Distributions
Investing in private equity takes less upfront cash than you might think. Since the typical investment period is seven to 10 years, the full commitment gets spread out over time via capital calls. In most cases, the upfront capital is only 25 percent.*
Through the J-Curve, sophisticated investors create a ""self-funding"" portfolio by investing in several funds or vintages. Over time, distributions from older funds can offset capital calls from new ones — further reducing your cash flow requirements.
*Please see fund documentation for details. Moonfare may call more than 25% upfront if needed by the underlying investment fund. The illustrative cash flows are not intended as a demonstration or forecast of investment returns. They are provided as an example of typical cash flows for the types of investment vehicles included in the cash flow simulation. No specific cash flow is guaranteed and past performance is not indicative of future performance.

Moonfare Pulse 2025: committed to the fundamentals of private equity
April 2, 2025
7 pages |
4 minutes
About the report
The Moonfare Pulse 2025 report tracks allocation trends on the Moonfare platform from January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2024, highlighting how 4,764 eligible individual investors collectively committed $3.3 billion to private market assets. These investors had to meet certain criteria which may include a minimum financial instrument portfolio and sufficient prior investment experience. Investors were domiciled in Europe, the US and Asia.
‍Key takeaways
Investors on the Moonfare platform remain committed to the fundamentals of private markets with buyout funds capturing almost half of all allocations in 2024, roughly similar to the previous two years.
There’s noticeably more appetite for venture capital — the value of investments into these funds increased in 2024, to 15.2%.
Investors with greater financial resources are more inclined toward higher-risk, higher reward investments like venture capital, compared to those with more limited means.

If you are unsure about anything, you should seek financial advice from an authorised advisor. Past performance is not a reliable guide to future returns.

Important information
Moonfare does not make investment recommendations and no communication, through this website or in any other medium should be construed as a recommendation for any security offered on or off this investment platform. Alternative investments in private placements, and private equity investments via feeder funds in particular, are speculative and involve a high degree of risk and those investors who cannot afford to lose their entire investment should not invest. Prospective investors should carefully consider the risk warnings and disclosures for the respective fund or investment vehicle set out therein. The value of an investment may go down as well as up and investors may not get back their money originally invested. Past performance is not necessarily a guide to future performance. An investment in a fund or investment vehicle is not the same as a deposit with a banking institution. Please refer to the respective fund documentation for details about potential risks, charges and expenses. Additionally, investors will typically receive illiquid and/or restricted membership interests that may be subject to holding period requirements and/or liquidity concerns. In the most sensible investment strategy for private equity investing, private equity should only be part of your overall investment portfolio. Further, the private equity portion of your portfolio may include a balanced portfolio of different private equity funds. Investments in private equity are highly illiquid and those investors who cannot hold an investment for the long term (at least 10 years) should not invest.
¹ Minimum investment may vary by country and local regulation.
