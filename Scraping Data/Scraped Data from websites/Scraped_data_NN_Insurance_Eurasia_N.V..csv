Responsible tax payer
NN Group’s tax strategy is aligned with our corporate values, care, clear, commit, which have an impact on how we look at tax. We believe that paying tax is more than a cost of doing business: it is a contribution to society. Our tax contributions play an important role for the communities in which we operate.

For more than 175 years, our company has merged, grown and changed, but the core of who we are has remained the same. At NN, we put our resources, expertise, and networks to use for the well-being of our customers, the advancement of our communities, the preservation of our planet, and for the promotion of a stable, inclusive, and sustainable economy. 

Our purpose is to help people care for what matters most to them. Because what matters to them matters to us.  

Therefore we asked people worldwide what really matters to them.

Our climate approach
Climate change is one of the most pressing risks of our time. The world has experienced many negative changes due to global warming, including extreme weather and disruptions in livelihood. If we do not take rapid action as a global community, there will be lasting consequences to ecosystems, human health and security.

Privacy statement NN Group N.V.
About this privacy statement
This is the privacy statement of NN Group N.V. (“NN’). The address of NN is Schenkkade 65, 2595 AS, The Hague, The Netherlands.
NN and its subsidiaries do their best to ensure that your personal data is processed in such a way that your privacy is protected and safeguarded as far as possible. Personal data is data that tells something about you or that we can connect with you. We call the collection, retention and use of your personal data ‘processing’. NN and its subsidiaries comply in the processing of your personal data with applicable data protection legislation and regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”).
NN Group Data Protection Framework
We have an extensive groupwide data protection framework in place to process and protect personal data in compliance with applicable data protection laws. Our (internal) Data Protection Policy addresses compliance with the GDPR and other relevant data protection laws and regulations in relationto its entire range of activities and applies to all NN entities established in the EU which process personal data or NN Group entities that process personal data of data subjects within the EU. Compliance is monitored closely and documented systematically.
Fair, transparent and secure processing of personal data
All entities within NN Group obtain and process personal data in a fair and transparent manner. Personal data is solely processed for specified legitimate business purposes and on the basis of appropriate legal grounds. Personal data is not further processed in a way incompatible with these purposes. We only share personal data with third parties (such as intermediaries and service providers/suppliers) if this is needed for a legitimate business purpose and we have a solid legal ground for doing so. Where needed we conclude adequate data processing agreements with such parties to safeguard the protection of personal data and require such third parties to maintain similar standards to ours for the protection of personal data, which is verified during our due diligence and assurance processes. We do not sell personal data to third parties.
We spend a lot of time and effort on the security of our systems and the personal data stored within them. We keep a constant watch over the security of our data traffic. We take immediate action in case something goes wrong. We resolve and register data breaches and report these to the supervisory authority and if necessary to you.
Data Protection Officers
The (internal) NN Group DPO Charter provides a mandatory framework pursuant to which the function of Data Protection Officer (“DPO”) is established. NN Group and all European business units have appointed a DPO and formally established the position, role and responsibilities of the DPO according to the aforementioned DPO Charter and the GDPR. The DPOs continuously monitor compliance with the GDPR and act as a point of contact for supervisory authorities and data subjects.
Our employees
In light of the NN Values (Care, Clear, Commit) and in accordance with the NN Code of Conduct all employees are expected to handle personal data of our customers, employees and business partners responsibly, keep confidential what is entrusted to them and act honestly, with care and diligence. The NN Code of Conduct reminds employees for example of the ‘need-to-know principle’ in requesting or providing personal data. We regularly verify who has access to our systems and personal data. In case of evident breaches disciplinary measures are imposed on employees. All employees are required to complete a GDPR e-learning. Furthermore our employees have signed a non-disclosure agreement and have taken an oath.
Record retention
On the basisof the internal NN Group Record Retention Policyall business units and legal entities must have retention schedules in place. We retain personal data for as long as required by law and no longer than necessary for the purpose for which we use the data. Data subjects can request for information on the applicable retention periods. Such information will be provided in a timely manner.
Data transfers outside the European Economic Area
Your personal data is generally processed in the European Economic Area (‘EEA’). In some cases however we can use the services of parties in countries outside the EEA. The regulations in such countries do not always provide the same level of personal data protection as in the EEA. To ensure that your personal data is safe nevertheless, we take measures in such cases by entering where needed into so-called standard contractual clauses.
Processing on NN Group website
When you visit the NN Group website, data is gathered by using cookies and similar technologies (“cookies”). NN processes log information and details of visitor behavior patterns. Your IP address can also be processed. This is the number that identifies the computer, tablet or mobile you use. NN does this to collect statistical information on the use of the website and to operate the website correctly. We can also process data for marketing purposes (to offer you customised advertisements). In our cookie statement we explain in more detail how and why we use cookies and provide information about the lifespan of cookies. NN will not further process personal data in a way incompatible with the mentioned purposes.
