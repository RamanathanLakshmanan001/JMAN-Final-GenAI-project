CHECKING IN FOR A YEAR OF GROWTH

MOORE GLOBAL LEADER, HOTELS & LEISURE
International hotel operators, owners and investors are looking to the future with confidence after a remarkably strong year in which astute resource management and increased digitisation have helped sharpen performance and boost profitability.
The sector has reached a watershed moment. This year, sector leaders will no longer define success by comparing key performance indicators to ‘before’ and ‘after’ the global pandemic. Many hotel groups advanced into new territory in 2023 in terms of average daily rates (ADR), occupancy and revenue per available room (RevPAR) in 2023.
The prime focus in 2024 will be on defining and applying strategies, technologies and transactions that can help them scale new peaks of success.
Technological innovation, particularly use of Artificial Intelligence (AI), will be a key theme as the sector progresses from relatively low-level experimentation such as using chatbots for customer service and ChatGPT to create marketing campaigns, to bigger and bolder applications.
We are only beginning to glimpse the full range of possibilities for AI to transform hotel economics, from dynamic revenue management to security systems and energy and resource management.  New developments like smart sensors will also drive change.
Large international branded hotel groups are investing millions of dollars in AI applications. Some are running small scale pilots before committing to mass rollout but the pace of adoption is accelerating. The global AI in hospitality market was valued at $90 million in 2022 and is estimated to reach a value of $8.12 billion by 2033 with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 60%.
Significantly, we expect to see a digitalisation drive take place across geographies and across the spectrum of hotel groups in terms of ownership and size. After years of being characterised as slow to adopt new technologies, the hotels sector is drawing on the hard-won experience of having had to reinvent business models after the pandemic and taking a proactive approach to digital transformation.
Confidence is underpinned by forecasts of strong demand – Global Business Travel Association data show that global spending on business travel is expected to reach $1.5 trillion in 2024, exceeding pre-pandemic levels for the first time.
We also expect growing spend on ‘bleisure’ travel, which involves business guests staying for longer in locations and spending more in order to enjoy some leisure time when travelling. The value of the global bleisure market is expected to more than double from 2022 levels to $731.4 billion globally by 2032, a CAGR rate of 8.9%.
Global investor interest remains keen too as hotels are regarded as a particularly attractive class of commercial real estate while inflation remains relatively high, effective eroding the real value of fixed yields from office and retail property assets. Hotel operators’ ability to dynamically price rooms to adapt to different market circumstances is a key attraction, as well as solid underlying occupancy trends.
Relatively high interest rates over the past couple of years have kept the cost of borrowing high but the cost of capital should fall in 2024 and this is likely to stimulate more merger and acquisition activity in the sector.
Major branded international hotel chains are pursuing ambitious expansion strategies and they are particularly keen on increasing their footprint in fast-growing economic regions. The Middle East, Southeast Asia and strong European destinations will also continue to be investment hot spots.
Naturally some significant uncertainties and challenges remain for the sector, from geopolitical risks to the impact of an economic slowdown this year in some traditionally strong territories, such as Germany, as well as rising input costs and persistent skills shortages. The latter is being tackled by investment in skills, training and education opportunities as well as through reward and recognition programmes designed to hold on to and develop the best people.
The sector will also continue to face intense competitive pressures as hotels compete for guest custom and loyalty in a world where expectations of guest experiences are continually rising. However, the industry has demonstrated great resilience and determination in the fact of even greater challenges and is heading confidently into a new year, ready to seize opportunities to grow and prosper.

Sustainability: From Buzzword To Business Critical
SUSTAINABILITY: FROM BUZZWORD TO BUSINESS CRITICAL
21 OCTOBER 2024
Share
Ambitious mid-sized companies that embrace ESG principles have benefited financially but now they are nervous about a new wave of regulation that will compel them to vouch for the sustainability of every link in their global supply chains.
Almost half (46.5%) of businesses surveyed by Moore Global have implemented comprehensive governance practices to meet a higher level of scrutiny.
However, they are concerned about external risks such as supply chain disruptions and cybersecurity attacks that could impact their efforts to comply with the new rules.
The findings emerge from a long-term research project undertaken by Moore Global that has tracked the evolution of Environmental, Social and Governance issues – the three pillars of ESG that companies of all sizes now have to bear in mind as they plan ahead.
“This is one of the most comprehensive studies of ambitious, mid-sized companies’ attitudes towards ESG, risk management and governance,” says Moore Global CEO Anton Collela. “It shows that sustainability has moved from being a buzzword in boardrooms to business critical.”
“The companies we spoke to are the engine of the global economy, so how they view the future is incredibly important for all of us. They are tackling complex issues and may have to make significant changes to the way they have operated for decades.”
The study was conducted for Moore by the Centre for Economic and Business Research (Cebr). It reflects the changing attitudes and concerns of almost 4,000 business leaders in 12 key economies spanning the Americas, Europe, Asia, Africa and the Middle East.
Over the three years of our research, sustainability and ESG have risen up the agenda of investors, banks, regulators and customers.
Now, there is a new regulatory framework emerging that will increase due diligence and require companies to audit their activities in order to adhere to a tougher governance regime.
“What we are seeing is a rapidly changing regulatory landscape for mid-sized companies across the globe,” says Mark Stewart, Moore’s Global ESG leader. “Many mid-market companies are becoming more aware of the impact ESG risks can have on their operations, especially in terms of reputation, regulatory compliance and access to capital.”
The EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) requires companies to report on the impact of their activities on the environment and society. Meanwhile, the International Sustainability Standards Board aims to deliver a global baseline of sustainability-related disclosure standards, focused on the needs of investors.
In the US, there is a proposed rule change to the Federal Acquisition Regulation that would require certain federal contractors to disclose their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and climate-related financial risk. They would also have to set science-based targets to reduce their GHG emissions.
Our investigation reveals that only 55% of businesses surveyed are completely confident about their organisation’s awareness of upcoming regulatory changes.
Among business leaders that are not completely confident in their organisation’s awareness of impending regulatory changes, the most common reason for doubt was the complexity of regulatory requirements, according to 39% of respondents.
Other reasons included: a lack of clear information or guidance on regulatory changes (38%); limited internal resources or expertise to keep up with updates (36%) and previous difficulties in compliance with regulatory changes (30%).
More than 80% of businesses have already adjusted their operations in response to upcoming regulatory changes, although the contrast between the world’s largest economies is stark.
In the US, 42% of surveyed businesses – the equivalent of 22,000 individual companies – have already significantly altered their operations in response to upcoming regulatory changes. Mobilisation rates among European members of the G7, France, Germany, Italy and the UK, are between 30% and 35%.
Japan, the world’s third largest economy, is lagging with only 11% of companies altering business practices in response to upcoming regulations. The country is both a major exporter and foreign investor and the new rules will impact companies that trade across borders.
The bureaucracy of further regulation is often cited as a drag on business and economic growth but our survey shows that those that have embraced the emerging new regime have enjoyed financial benefits.
Of decision makers surveyed, 63% reported that previous regulatory changes positively impacted their organisation’s finances and a similar number (57%) expect upcoming changes to also have a positive impact on the bottom line.
However, this optimism is not universally shared. Emerging economies, like the UAE, Brazil and South Africa are very positive but that optimistic mindset is shared by less than half of the respondents in more developed economies that have already had to adapt to many changes of regulatory regimes.
A raft of new regulations brings a need for greater oversight – once again, readiness is patchy across the globe. Some 46% of business leaders have already implemented comprehensive governance practices but almost as many – 42% – say they have introduced some measures “but there is room for improvement”.
Among the most far-reaching of the impending regulations are requirements on companies of all sizes to be able to demonstrate the sustainability of their entire supply chains of suppliers, no matter where they are based.
Around 45% of decision makers reported that supply chain disruptions pose more risk now than they did five years ago.
More than half of businesses expect to conduct supply chain audits more frequently in the future – with the frequency highest in banking and finance.
In Brazil, a country that is seeking to attract investment from the US, Europe and Asia, 56% of firms conduct audits at least four times a year against the global average of 3.6 per year.
This risk of cyber attacks has leaders of mid-market companies extremely worried, perhaps a reflection of the fact they may lack the cyber security sophistication of multinational corporations.
Around 85% of companies worry about cyber attacks having negative financial impacts on their organisations and more than half (55%) believe cyber-attacks pose more risk now than they did five years ago.
It is clear from our unique study that the new business reality for mid-sized companies is very different from pre-Covid days. However, those that have adapted to the changes have done well and in many cases they are now more sustainable than before.

Escaping The Sustainability Transparency Trap
ESCAPING THE SUSTAINABILITY TRANSPARENCY TRAP
29 JANUARY 2025
Share
Brazil’s beleaguered coffee growers, still reeling from 2024’s poor harvest, are confronting a fresh challenge – to comply with new sustainability rules created 9,000km away in Brussels to protect the Amazon rainforest.
Their concern centres around the new EU Regulation on Deforestation-free Products (EUDR) that states producers must be able to prove that their products do not originate from recently deforested land or have not contributed to forest degradation.
While many large producers are already able to comply, the smaller companies in their supply chains often do not have the necessary reporting systems in place. In future, failure to disclose sustainability related financial information which has been independently assured may exclude companies from international export markets.
“Historically, many companies in the EU have waited for legislation to be imposed before significantly ramping up their efforts to provide sustainability information,” says Mark Stewart, the Moore network’s global leader on sustainability and a partner at member firm Johnston Carmichael. “In putting it off as long as possible a form of panic can set in when they realise deadlines are fast approaching.
“However, there is a less stressful way of going about this by preparing to meet the requirements of the regulations without having to completely reinvent the business.”
Stewart warns mid-sized companies against falling into the “Transparency Trap” which can eat into precious time and financial reserves. Some regulations may cover more than 1,000 individual data points but not every company has to provide all of this information.
“Our advice is: break it down into bite-size chunks, and to be prepared ahead of the curve,” he says. “We know what regulators want in most jurisdictions, so it’s about getting the business in shape to collect the data to meet those demands.
“Focusing on what is material, based on business type and industry sector, is the best way to reduce the information you are required to gather and analyse.”
The first step is for businesses to review their existing financial reporting capabilities to understand where they may not comply with new sustainability disclosure rules. This allows SMEs to proactively prepare for any required disclosures and align practices with the regulations.
By establishing a robust reporting framework now, SMEs can avoid scrambling to gather the necessary data when legislation comes into force.  
SMEs should begin communicating with key stakeholders – customers, suppliers and investors – about their sustainability efforts and policies. This engagement allows companies to identify areas where they can collaborate with suppliers or adjust business models to meet sustainability goals.
The EU is leading the way on sustainability and ESG with its Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), requiring companies to report on the impact of their activities on the environment and society.
Meanwhile, European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) already oblige larger companies to report both on their impacts on people and the environment and on how social and environmental issues create financial risks and opportunities for the company. The rules will extend to small companies over the next two years.
The UK is also at the forefront of regulation in this area and its Sustainability Reporting Standards (UK SRS) will come into effect in January 2026, with the first reports due in 2027. “UK based SMEs have time to get prepared for impending legislation but they should start planning for it now.” Says Mark Stewart. 
In this Global Snapshot, Moore’s experts examine developments in other markets.
How Brussels rules impact Brazilian coffee farmers

The wider impact of decisions made in Brussels can be seen in the coffee-growing regions of Brazil. For the farmers and exporters who buy their beans the EU’s Regulation on Deforestation-free Products (EUDR) will have a profound impact on their ability to sell into their biggest market.
Brazil is the largest producer and exporter of coffee but 72% of Brazil’s coffee producers are smallholder farmers, cultivating on 20 hectares or less. Of these, 47% are family-owned businesses that export to the EU – and many lack the sophisticated systems required to demonstrate compliance with the EUDR.
Major coffee producers are taking the initiative and creating tools that can prove their locally harvested beans did not come from deforested areas. However, one major concern remains: most coffees are a blend that use beans from other countries and guaranteeing the traceability of supplies from Ethiopia, for example, is difficult.
The stakes are high. As well as coffee, the directive applies to soy, beef, palm oil, coffee, cocoa, rubber, wood and derivatives, including leather and furniture. Commodities affected by the EUDR earn Brazil around $15 billion in exports – one-third of its total overseas revenues.
For smaller growers the problem is more mundane: how to create systems that prove to the big producers they sell to that they are compliant with all financial reporting regulations. Moore Belo Horizonte is at the forefront of efforts to help mid-sized agri-businesses develop templates that allow them to meet their obligations quickly and easily.
“EUDR affects many companies, such as those in the coffee and beef sectors, because if they do not take action, they will be forbidden to export to Europe. Now every time we talk to a company, the first thing we ask them is who are their big clients and main suppliers. From that we can work out the very first steps they must take to be compliant.”

  India’s pragmatic approach

As rapidly growing Indian companies become bigger players on the world stage, there is an increased demand for information on sustainability from investors, regulators and other stakeholders.
The Securities Exchange Board of India rolled out a Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) framework, which requires the top 1,000 companies by market capitalisation to disclose their sustainability and ESG initiatives.
There are a set of around 40 key performance indicators classified under nine attributes, referred to as BRSR Core, covering everything from their energy footprints to enhancing employee wellbeing and fairness in dealing with suppliers and customers.
From 2025-26 the BRSR Core framework also requires the top 250 companies to track sustainability KPIs of partners in their value chains.
And when it comes to assurance, India has taken a more pragmatic approach than the EU, preferring to focus on rigorous assurance of a small number of key metrics – around 40 – rather than limited assurance of the whole range of possible metrics.
Getting to this point has been a challenge, especially for mid-sized companies. Though they often had the data required, it was not captured in the way that acceptable to the regulator.
Moore Singhi has been helping many of those data-challenged businesses to embed systems that allow the free flow of all relevant information up the supply chain to their main customers and on to the regulators.
One of the main befits of a positive approach to the sustainability and ESG agenda revealed in Moore Global research was the impact on customer retention and brand image.
The Moore Singhi team have noticed a growing trend among Indian companies exposed to the European market to do more on transparency than the regulations mandate in order to demonstrate commitment to being good corporate citizens.
“It started as a compliance issue but people do now see the value of good governance and realising that by implementing ESG, they are able to identify the risks that the company is exposed to. Investing in robust data systems and engaging value chain partners allows Indian businesses to drive a meaningful sustainability agenda and gain a competitive edge in the global market.”

K-pop offers ESG insight in Korea

Like their Indian counterparts, South Korea’s businesses with big footprints in western markets are also faced with the challenge of dealing with tighter sustainability and ESG regulation abroad than they have experienced at home.
In 2021, the Financial Services Commission in Seoul said it would gradually broaden the scope of mandatory ESG disclosure, commencing with companies with assets of more than 2 trillion won ($1.3 billion) by 2025 and eventually encompassing all stock market-listed companies by 2030.
However, this met resistance from business quarters and the requirement for ESG disclosure mandates was pushed back to after 2026 and the date may slip to 2029. However, large international brands like Hyundai and Samsung are already monitoring their own performance.
If the ‘G’ in ESG (Governance) is a work in progress, perhaps an even bigger challenge for Korea is the ‘S’ – Social.
More highly educated women are entering the workforce and are not prepared to accept the old norms of male domination in corporate hierarchies. They also face a 31.2% gender wage gap – the widest among OECD countries.
Research by the University of Sheffield found that companies that hire more permanent female staff and reduced their reliance on temporary contractual workers performed better financially over the long term.
An unlikely answer to this thorny ‘Social’ question in the ESG debate may be found in the glitzy world of K-pop. With its catchy tunes and synchronised dance routines it is now a global phenomenon of that is now worth more than $40 billion to the economy. One boy band alone, BTS, is reported to contribute 0.3% of Korean GDP
K-pop has become a global phenomenon – but there have also been tragedies of performers dying young followed by revelations of intolerable pressures and lop-sided contracts.
This has led a country that has been slow to embrace ESG to understand the need for minimum standards and ensuring the well-being of employees – which, essentially, is what most K-pop performers are in terms of employment status.
Hyesung Accounting Corporation, a correspondent firm in the Moore network, has organised investment conferences in Seoul in recent years and has seen Korean companies taking ESG more seriously as they realise that international investment now comes with sustainability strings attached.
“Almost all of the investors we speak to consider sustainability and ESG factors when they are selecting investments, so there is definitely more awareness of the issues. Newer companies realise that if they don't have minimum processes in place, they could miss out.”

The green dilemma facing car industry suppliers
THE GREEN DILEMMA FACING CAR INDUSTRY SUPPLIERS
28 FEBRUARY 2024
Share
By Thomas Ziegler
 
Moore's Global Leader, Automotive

Suppliers in the automotive industry are facing difficult decisions about retooling factories for the electric vehicle revolution just as the world’s leading car makers are signalling that EVs are not the only way forward they are considering. This all makes investment decisions more complex.
 
In the face of stalling sales of EVs, many large car brands are noticeably more pragmatic about the future shape of the industry, emphasising a continuing role for the traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) alongside battery power and a wide range of less carbon-intensive “e-fuels”.
 
BloombergNEF predicts 16.7 million sales of EV passenger cars in 2024, a rise of 21% overall. That sounds healthy but the disparity between markets is making car manufacturers wary. Europe is expected to be flat, US sales might be pulled lower by political considerations and a reduction in incentives, while Chinese growth is slowing because of market saturation and economic concerns among middle class consumers.
 
In January the chairman of Toyota, the world’s second largest car manufacturer, predicted electric vehicles would never make up more than 30% of global car sales. Akio Toyoda, grandson of the company founder, restated his long-held view that alternative fuels like hydrogen offered more benefits in terms of manufacturing and running costs – and this from the man whose predecessors built the first mass-market EV, the Prius, back in 1997.
 
For Tier 1 suppliers like Bosch, Delphi or Getrag, this hesitancy causes headaches because they have to decide how to split research and development budgets across different propulsion systems. But for the Tier 2 suppliers to whom they outsource development of many highly specialised components, the uncertainty is more acute.
 
Many of today’s leading Tier 2 suppliers have evolved into sophisticated precision manufacturers, developing impressive technology along the way. However, it is unrealistic for a company that produces a highly engineered engine component for fossil-fuelled cars to shift seamlessly to making parts for battery-powered vehicles.
 
Batteries only have 20 key moving parts against around 200 in a traditional engine – and the highly integrated Chinese supply chain has a huge lead in many aspects of EV technology, leaving suppliers in the rest of the world trailing in their wake.
 
The starkest example of this market power is the January sales chart that showed China’s BYD overtaking Tesla as the world’s leading producer of all-battery EVs.
 
Switching to new factories and new EV-related products, if it is even possible for suppliers, will cost billions of dollars across the whole supply chain. Most Tier 2 suppliers are family-owned and rely on their own cash resources and bank loans to fund the work, so it is a big ask.
 
Making car parts is a relatively low margin business and it requires huge volumes to make reasonable profits. There is every chance the big car manufacturers will look to tighten those margins even further to free up cash to fund their own investment in new technologies.
 
Banks may have funded these essentially strong, solid businesses for decades but their lending criteria are changing and investors are pushing them to withdraw from sectors that revolve around fossil fuels.
 
Except, of course, that it is clear that petrol and diesel cars will continue in production for some time. There will also be huge investment by the big brands, such as BMW and VW, to develop ever more fuel-efficient internal combustion engines – and, as now, they will look to their traditional supply chain to give them an edge.
 
I suspect the outcome of this global game of chess will be a lot of consolidation among the highly efficient traditional suppliers. It is quite likely those deals will attract the necessary funds, most probably from private equity. Closer cooperation and joint ventures with Tier 1 customers one step up the supply chain are also likely to develop.
 
While uncertainty will continue to be a feature of the market for the foreseeable future, it is also likely to spur the creation of a new ecosystem with closer relationships between car makers and their suppliers.
 
In this environment, agile and well-funded entrepreneurial businesses will find themselves well positioned to forge new partnerships which give them a lucrative stake in an increasingly diverse global automotive market.
 
It may well be that companies do not have to choose between the old world of ICE and the new era of EVs. Perhaps they can do both.

A blockbuster year in media with many plot twists
A BLOCKBUSTER YEAR IN MEDIA WITH MANY PLOT TWISTS
18 JANUARY 2024

BY GRAHAM TYLER
MOORE GLOBAL LEADER, MEDIA
Everything has changed in the media landscape in the aftermath of the Hollywood strikes that united writers and actors last year. The result is 2024 will see the emergence of new business models, AI embedded in the creative process and the emergence of new centres of production.
Despite the disruption caused to release schedules by industrial action, cinema chains had a relatively good year, albeit as a result of a big bump in revenues in the summer with the much-hyped releases of Barbie and Oppenheimer.
The lack of a “Barbenheimer” blockbuster effect in 2024 means cinema groups are facing a year of stagnant or falling audiences and financial pressure will continue to mount on many movie theatre chains.
In recent years, filmmakers have been able to make up for losses in cinema revenue by striking distribution deals with streamers. The streaming market has been booming since the early days of Covid lockdown and has attracted a large number of new entrants taking on the established order, led by Netflix.
However, the streaming universe is now both crowded and fragmented. In fact, around of the main 100 streamers have fewer than 5 million subscribers.
It seems unlikely there is enough room for all of these services so consolidation looks inevitable in 2024. In short, streaming is a sector where I expect to see a lot of M&A activity.
We will probably see a lot of deals in advertising as well. The sector had a very tough year in 2023 and there are now two schools of thought as to how this year will play out.
The pessimistic view is that the ongoing effects of global economic uncertainty coupled with the conflicts in Ukraine and Middle East will convince advertisers to keep a lid on marketing budgets.
On a more positive note, there will be elections in 50 countries this year, a summer Olympics in Paris and the European Football Championship – all typically huge magnets for advertising.
In this more positive scenario, these major events will drive a strong bounce-back of the whole industry. As a natural optimist, I am swayed by these arguments.
During the Hollywood strikes of 2023 there was a lot of talk about the impact of AI on the film and television industry. Now that the strikes have been settled, I suspect that the level of noise will decrease but AI is now embedded in the creative process and will continue to develop both in its scope and scale.
Another unexpected outcome of the writers’ and actors’ strikes has been to shine a spotlight on Hollywood as the acknowledged epicentre of filmmaking.
Producers had to find new non-US locations to complete projects in the second half of last year and realised that California is an expensive place to make movies with many restrictive working practices.
With AI able to recreate any location in the world, other cheaper production hubs have been winning a bigger share of production work. Mexico has all the necessary skills, the border is only 140 miles from Hollywood and production costs are 30% lower.
In the UK, four new production facilities will come on stream around London, while other European countries offer attractive tax breaks and have extremely good facilities.
However, the surprises might be South Korea and Saudi Arabia. The rise of K-Pop has fuelled interest in Seoul’s tech-driven creative base while media is another industry where Saudi oil money will be used to woo producers. Around $50 billion is being invested in cultural projects, including a vast digital media hub called Neom.
So even without the next Barbie movie, it is going to be a blockbuster year with lots of plot twists.

Africa: A Renewable Energy Powerhouse In Waiting
AFRICA: A RENEWABLE ENERGY POWERHOUSE IN WAITING

Partner, Moore Oman
The transformation in Africa’s economic prospects is staggering. After decades of stagnation, many nations are now powering ahead with impressive GDP figures – the question now is how to ensure rapid growth improves people’s lives.
The African Development Bank predicts 3.8% GDP growth this year for the continent and 4.2% in 2025. This is significantly higher than the global average, making Africa the second-fastest growing region after Asia.
Of course, that scale of economic development requires vast amounts of energy: think of the huge quantities of fossil fuels China and India have burned over the past 30 years to become superpowers. However, an oil and gas fuelled industrial revolution in Africa, a continent of 1.4 billion people, would be disastrous for wider attempts to control global warming.
It need not be this way because there are sufficient – and largely untapped – sources of sustainable and renewable energy to offset the carbon emissions of fossil fuels that will continue play an important role in many large-scale infrastructure projects.
Some incredible opportunities exist with renewables and liquefied natural gas (LNG) to bring cleaner power to remote areas where there is still a huge tranche of the population cooking on unpleasant, unhealthy charcoal. They will probably use kerosene to provide light or the village might have diesel generators, which are again expensive, dirty and harmful to their own environment.
Renewables could be an easier option to expand access to electricity without the need to rely on traditional transmission grids. Meanwhile, the widespread adoption of mobile money has enabled innovative financing models for off-grid solar systems.  
Various renewable energy projects, including solar and wind, are being implemented across East Africa to diversify the energy mix and boost sustainability. Countries like Rwanda, Kenya and Tanzania have been investing in solar and wind farms to harness their abundant natural energy resources.
In South Africa there was an estimated 7.8GW of solar capacity at the end of 2023, representing nearly 50% of all installed capacity on the continent. The amount of generating capacity installed on homes and commercial premises is soon expected to surpass the total the government has procured in solar energy over the past decade.
Regional integration can unlock the potential for cross-border energy trade and infrastructure development. Regional power pools and interconnectors can optimise resource utilisation, improve energy security, and foster economic development.
The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam exemplifies the transformative power of cross-border collaboration. It will be the largest hydroelectric power plant in Africa when it is completed, with a capacity of over 6,000 megawatts supplying Ethiopia and its neighbours.
Kenya has been focusing on expanding its electricity generation capacity. It is also involved in a power interconnection project with Tanzania to enhance electricity trade between the two countries and improve energy security.
Renewables cannot do all the heavy lifting – nor should they. There are vast oil and gas reserves in Africa that could provide cheaper power at home and valuable export income from resource-constrained overseas markets like Europe.
Nigeria, responsible for two million barrels of crude oil per day, is the largest oil producer in Africa and one of the top oil exporters globally. However, there are also big deposits in Angola, Algeria, Egypt and Libya that have not been fully optimised.
With up-to-date equipment, they could exploit growing demand for LNG, which is seen as a cleaner alternative to petrol and diesel. In fact, a highly efficient plant would make enough LNG to satisfy the host country’s household energy needs as well as generating enough to sell – at higher profits – to petrochemical and animal feed producers. Equally energy-intensive industries like steel-making and large-scale manufacturing would also benefit using from cleaner electricity sources.
The right approach could deliver a win-win for Africa – it could turbocharge industrialisation, boost export income and deliver cheap and secure sources of energy that will transform the lives of families and the growth prospects for business.

OPENING UP TO THE WORLD

Managing Partner, Moore Johannesburg
On my frequent travels to mining hotspots like Zimbabwe, Zambia, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the pervasive influence of China is unmistakable. From billboards to construction hoardings, consumer products to store fronts, Chinese characters are a common sight, reflecting the deep economic ties fostered through numerous infrastructure projects.
These visual markers, initially prominent only in the capital cities, have now become familiar across numerous cities and towns throughout the region. However, the communities associated with these advertisements have diversified. Originally dominated by Chinese expatriates, these areas are now vibrant with newcomers from India, Brazil, and Russia, all drawn by the economic opportunities in these burgeoning lands.
I understand their enthusiasm because African nations will account for eleven of the world’s 20 fastest-growing economies in 2024, according to the African Development Bank. Rapid growth is a result of economic diversification strategies focused on increased investment in key sectors, domestic policies aimed at consolidating fiscal positions and boosting private consumption.
The Southern African Development Community (SADC) has been particularly proactive in advancing regional infrastructure projects, especially in the energy sector. Notable achievements include the Mozambique-Malawi and Zambia-Tanzania energy interconnector projects, enhancing energy reliability in the region.
Nigeria, alone, has 55 construction projects valued at $100 billion and the pace and scale of construction there and in Egypt, South Africa, Uganda and Kenya are unprecedented.
Much of the current wave of investment is coming from the so-called BRICs: Brazil, India, China and Russia – which explains the multi-language advertising billboards.
In the past decade they have had the choice of the best projects on the continent – perhaps because the huge investments required were underwritten by governments and so payment could be made in energy, raw materials and agriculture products.
Western investors generally do not have the same latitude for doing deals that are outside normal financial parameters and expectations of returns. They have also been put off by historic perceptions of investment risks.
However, there has been a discernible change in sentiment following a US-Africa leaders’ summit in December 2022 which seemed to galvanise US investor interest in the potential returns from energy and infrastructure projects on the continent.
In 2023, the White House says the United States supported $14.2 billion in new two-way trade and investment between with African countries, a 60% increase over the previous year.
Earlier this year, the European Union and African Development Bank signed a new framework agreement which the EU hopes will boost its Global Gateway infrastructure initiative in Africa through which it plans to invest €150 billion up to 2027.
The other big development is that many more African projects are now more “investment ready”.
South Africa has launched initiatives like the Africa Green Hydrogen Alliance and the Just Energy Transition Investment Plan to promote renewable energy development and achieve decarbonisation commitments. Along with Egypt and Morocco, it is poised to lead the way in green hydrogen production, with McKinsey estimating the continent could supply its entire domestic demand by 2050.
Elsewhere, Sudan, Tanzania and Kenya are now working together while Rwanda has emerged from a troubled recent past to be ranked as the continent’s second-best performer in the World Bank’s ease of doing business index.
Energy markets in most African countries have been dominated by state-owned utilities with huge inefficiencies and financial constraints but new financing options are emerging that are more attractive to international investors.
We have recently seen a big rise in deals involving export credit agency-supported funding, development finance institutions and private equity, as well as transition finance instruments like green bonds.
The Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) and initiatives like Power Africa are also mobilising significant funding to support clean energy projects and address Africa’s infrastructure gap.
As well as crumbling energy grids, most railways and ports are state owned and in desperate need of modernisation. The presence of new ranks of international investors willing to take on these huge challenges promises to transform vast swathes of the African economy.

A quantum leap for customer service
A QUANTUM LEAP FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE
23 JANUARY 2024
Share
BY EWEN FLEMING
MOORE GOOBAL FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR LEADER
 
Financial services companies will face increased pressure this year to prove that their products are trusted by customers – and do not lead to them being worse off.

This regulatory scrutiny has the potential to enhance consumer trust in an industry whose reputation was tarnished by the 2008 financial crisis and its lingering impact but it will cause some fundamental changes in the way providers design, market and monitor the effectiveness of their products and services.

The UK will be the test bed of this new approach and the rollout of new Consumer Duty rules is being watched carefully in other financial centres. The objective is to drive good outcomes for retail customers by setting clearer and higher standards of consumer protection.

Providers will be compelled to make financial products easier to understand and demonstrate that they acted in a way designed to deliver good customer outcomes – and can also show evidence these goals have been met.

This will create headaches for financial services firms in the first half of the year as they refine products, processes and pricing while simultaneously building new datasets and upgrading governance structures. Executives and boards will be held accountable for the fairness of current products as well as those that have already been sold, possibly years ago.

One impact of the new approach is that consumers are likely to be more directly involved in the design of financial products and the introduction of robust and systematic mechanisms to gauge levels of customer satisfaction, loyalty and trust.

This will involve a combination of traditional human interaction and next-generation technology.

There will be focus groups, customer surveys and face-to-face meetings to scope out the broad outline of new products while, behind the scenes, quantum computing will be utilised to crunch the mountains of data firms hold in order to enhance risk assessment, decision-making and fraud detection. Cloud computing platforms are vital to this technology revolution and banks’ spending in this area is forecast to grow to $77 billion by end of 2024, according to research by IDC.

Two more big developments will have an impact in 2024, one short term and the other long term.

The short term outlook for interest rates appears to show a downward trajectory. This is generally regarded as good news for consumers and businesses who would be expected to borrow more as the cost of money falls. That, in turn, should promote economic growth.

This appears to be good news for finance companies but there is a sting in the tail. Many of them have profited from a widening of their net interest margin (NIM) as central bank base rates were frequently hiked to tame inflation. With base rates now believed to have plateaued it is likely that NIM will narrow in 2024 and 2025, with firms experiencing a squeeze on profit margins.

The longer term development is the rise of central bank digital currencies (CBCDs). Around 100 countries are exploring their potential adoption: the Bahamas, Jamaica, and Nigeria have implemented CBDCs while the European Central Bank is inviting tenders from vendors to provide the plumbing for a digital euro.

The idea behind these is that a digital dollar or euro would offer many of the convenience benefits of commercial cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin but without the volatility that can see their values fluctuate wildly – and central banks cannot go bust, unlike crypto exchanges.

The rise of CBDCs seems inevitable, and it remains to be seen how central banks and commercial banks work together. A big worry for commercial banks is that they see their value chain deconstructed, as happened with the emergence of new payments providers in the last decade.

However, the more probable scenario is that they will remain connected directly to their customers and support central banks with the administration of these assets to minimise overheads. They will probably end up using crypto deposits as a source of funding, just as they do with traditional currency.

We expect to see the accelerated adoption of CBDC leading to standardised cross-border regulation. While this may increase the burden of compliance, the positive end result will be greater market stability and improved trust in the vitally important financial services sector.

Trust And Talent: The Crucial Ingredients
TRUST AND TALENT: THE CRUCIAL INGREDIENTS
3 APRIL 2025
Share
Artificial Intelligence and new digital innovations are revolutionising the way accountancy and advisory services are delivered, yet this throws up more rather than fewer challenges for the leaders of the profession.
While technology can streamline processes, it cannot replace the human intuition and experience that can make the difference between a successful outcome and a disappointment.
This means fresh thinking – and new skill sets – will be required by the leaders of tomorrow. However, they must tread a fine line to integrate technology seamlessly while maintaining trust that IT solutions will be deployed in a way that truly delivers benefits.
Moore Global has been at the forefront of the debate on talent development and trust. Here Margie Alt, global director of talent, and Tony Caldwell, global director of professional standards, explore these critical and timely issues.


Empowering our future leaders is not just about filling roles, it is about igniting potential and driving innovation.”
The profession is having to fight harder than ever to recruit the talent it needs. Projecting forward, if firms do not invest in the next generation of leaders now, they will face a dearth of leadership talent 10-15 years down the line.
According to a recent study, 77% of organisations already report leadership gaps. That stark statistic emphasises the urgent need for proactive leadership development.
Research also shows that companies that invest in leadership development programs are twice as likely to hit their performance targets and outperform their competitors by 2.3 times in revenue growth.
We recognised this looming problem five years ago and set up Moore Ambition to identify and train the next generation of leaders, placing particular emphasis on opening up participation to junior ranks within firms.
Every month our chairman Andy Armanino and CEO Anton Colella lead sessions across several time zones that challenge young highly accomplished accountants to look beyond their own specialist roles, to develop a lateral vision and to think like leaders.
Around 3,000 people have taken part and these initiatives have already delivered demonstrable benefits to the network.
It is clear that in a rapidly evolving world, the leaders we develop today will be the architects of our success tomorrow. Empowering our future leaders is not just about filling roles, it is about igniting potential and driving innovation.
By 2030, it is projected that millennials will make up 75% of the global workforce, making it essential to cultivate leadership skills in this demographic.
They see things differently than previous generations, conscious of financial rewards but equally focused on developing fulfilling careers. They are well-educated and sought after for their ability to connect with the upcoming generation of entrepreneurs and business leaders.
They challenge convention – a trait that can benefit a profession undergoing rapid change. However, developing, attracting and retaining a new cadre of innovative and energetic leaders requires both structural change and a shift in mindset within a traditionally hierarchical professional environment where people were accustomed to waiting patiently for promotion.

“It is now time for our profession to invest more in maintaining the high levels of trust it has long upheld—being proactive rather than resting on our laurels.”
As many aspects of annual account preparation, tax and audit become automated, opportunities for firms to have regular and potentially valuable personal interactions with clients may diminish.
Many business leaders value the trusted advisor at their side, guiding them as they expand and evolve their companies.
While new ways of working and remote tools at our disposal can deliver efficiency gains, we cannot afford to lose face time and the human aspect of what we do for clients.
High-profile audit scandals and spats between companies and activist investors over the veracity of financial data grab the headlines in today’s febrile media world – but the reality is that trust in our profession has increased since the end of Covid.
Accountants – and nurses – were the only professions to see an uplift in trust since 2021 while others like lawyers, bankers and insurance brokers saw their credibility diminish over the same period.
It is not difficult to see why. For many pandemic-hit businesses, the ability of their accountants to restructure their balance sheets, access alternative sources of capital and negotiate for leniency from banks and tax authorities was all that stood between them and oblivion.
This faith in our abilities and good intentions is a huge strength in these more sceptical times and differentiates us from other advisors. However, we must not take it for granted and now is the time to increase our investment in the attributes which are vital but difficult to quantify.
At Moore Global we have been leading the way with several pro-active initiatives to ensure our firms not only meet the highest ethical standards but can demonstrate this publicly.
We now devote 25% of our professional standards budget towards trust issues, taking on extra staff and building academies on everything from ethics to sustainability.
We are also the first network of our size to appoint a non-executive director with specific responsibility for professional standards. Nick Ong-Seng, a former Amazon executive, will have specific responsibility for ethics and quality management.
These commitments will have an impact on everything we do in our network and are a very public demonstration of our core belief that the value of trust to the profession cannot be over-emphasised.

BY COSTAS CONSTANTINOU
MOORE GLOBAL LEADER, MARITIME
The only certainty the shipping industry can rely on in 2024 is that it will be a year of uncertainty and unexpected shocks to the established order of world trade.
The companies that will emerge strongest from this period of unpredictability will be the most agile, both in deploying their financial resources and adjusting quickly to changing geopolitical or environmental factors.
Lines of communication from ship to shore, and between departments, will have to be shortened to react to ever-changing events and companies must ensure their cyber security is at the cutting edge so malign forces cannot hack into their systems and take control of vessels.
The maritime sector has been highly volatile since Covid. Shipping was hugely disrupted during the pandemic, forcing owners to borrow heavily to weather the storm. However, their balance sheets have been restored by a bounce-back in trade and halfway through 2023 ship owners were feeling upbeat as they had paid back the significant debts they had accumulated.
Also, the worst case scenario that many economists predicted – factories relocated near to home markets, reducing the amount of sea cargo – failed to materialise.
As those same companies enter a new year the outlook is very different. Continued military action in Ukraine combined with conflict in the Middle East and heightening tensions in Asia have forced many cargo lines back into emergency mode.
Container fleet operators rerouted vessels that would normally have sailed through the Suez Canal round the Cape of Good Hope in response to rocket attacks from Houthi rebels in Yemen against ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.
This adds 10-12 days to a trip and requires extra fuel. The knock-on effect is that ships find themselves out of position relative to their normal schedule which, in turn, results in bottlenecks and a shortage of free ships to move goods. The financial effect of all this is a doubling of cargo shipping rates, from around $1,400 for a standard 40-foot container from Shanghai to Rotterdam to $3,100.
Another unexpected factor is a lack of rain in tropical Central America. The result is that water levels in the Panama Canal – which handles $270 billion worth of global trade annually – have been so low that restrictions have been placed on the number of ships in the system at any one time.
However, shipping companies cannot focus solely on current problems as a considerable net zero challenge will begin to loom larger in 2024.
The current merchant fleet will struggle to meet the International Maritime Organisation’s ambition to reduce the carbon intensity of shipping by 40% by 2030 and reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.
The bill for new ships and parallel investment in alternative fuels and modernised port infrastructure will run into trillions of dollars.
Banks, the traditional source of lending, are now reluctant to advance loans to companies that cannot prove their green credentials, so having an independently verified ESG audit showing progress on reducing carbon emissions will become a minimum requirement.
One of the key areas lenders now focus on is the propulsion system. The diesel engines that power the majority of container ships are responsible for 3% of the world’s carbon emissions and pressure is being applied to find alternatives.
Various combinations of liquefied natural gas (LNG), ammonia and hydrogen have been proposed and each has advocates and advantages. The solution gaining ground more recently is nuclear power, which is currently restricted to ice breakers and naval aircraft carriers and submarines. A new generation of compact reactors could provide carbon-free power for merchant ships of all sizes.
Reaching a consensus on this crucial issue would at least give some clarity in what promises to be a year of squalls and storms.

INTERNAL AUDIT
We perform internal audit services to professionals, for example, in the financial sector (PSF), Management Companies (ManCo 15, ManCo 16, AIFM) and Investment Firms.

Regulated entities in Luxembourg require an internal audit function. Yet for small or medium sized companies it is often more efficient to outsource this function to an external expert, freeing internal resources and saving costs.

Synergies resulting from our experienced staff are used to your advantage. In addition to the predictable costs, outsourcing guaranties objectivity and independence.

Our internal audit team offers an in-depth knowledge of the Luxembourg financial market, as well as strong technical skills. We offer a high level of professionalism, which is reflected in an efficient audit process.

We can answer short-term requirements in a timely and flexible way, providing competent solutions.

Examples of Internal Audits we offer:
Establishment of the Internal Audit Function
Quality control of the existing Internal Audit Function
Financial Audit (as Outsourcing Partner)
Compliance Audit
Embezzlement Audit
Operational Audit
Internal control systems in accordance with SOX 404 and CSSF 98/143 regulation

The “New Normal” For Business In 2025
THE “NEW NORMAL” FOR BUSINESS IN 2025
20 NOVEMBER 2024
Share
By Samuel Miley
 
As business leaders survey the “new normal” of the post-Covid landscape, they are increasingly realising that long-term success hinges not just on profitability but on resilience, responsibility and technological foresight.

The past few years have witnessed profound changes in the way companies operate, driven by external shocks like war and the pandemic, combined with the push for sustainability, digital transformation and governance reform. These shifts have forced companies to re-evaluate traditional models and embrace new frameworks for managing risk and driving innovation.

For mid-market firms, an economic backdrop for 2025 of slow but steady growth provides a cautiously optimistic outlook. These companies, often more agile than large corporations but with more resources than small businesses, are well-positioned to capitalise on recovery trends.

How we got here has been a fascinating journey. For the past three years we at the Centre for Economics and Business Research (Cebr) have been working with Moore Global to survey mid-market businesses in the world’s key markets to explore their attitudes towards these structural changes: it has been very revealing.

Post-pandemic realities
The Covid-19 pandemic fundamentally reshaped how businesses operate, with hybrid working models becoming a lasting feature of the corporate world. In fact, 77% of businesses now support remote and hybrid working, signalling a significant shift from pre-pandemic norms.

The impact of hybrid working has been largely positive, with many businesses reporting productivity gains. This is corroborated by other research, such as Cebr’s study for Virgin Media, showing that Covid-driven digital change can significantly boost employee productivity, equating to an additional two hours of work per day for remote workers.

However, the extent of its success varies significantly across industries. In sectors such as IT and finance, where face-to-face interaction is less critical, Moore Global’s survey found that around 70% of businesses reported that hybrid working had a very positive effect on productivity.

In contrast, industries such as tourism, public services and healthcare that rely heavily on in-person interactions reported lower levels of productivity improvements.

Another significant change in the post-pandemic world has been the shift in consumer behaviour. E-commerce has boomed, with businesses across various sectors recognising the long-term potential of online sales. The pandemic accelerated this shift, making online shopping a default choice for many.

Sectors such as electronics, IT, and retail have especially benefited from the surge in e-commerce, with both business-to-business (B2B) and direct-to-consumer markets adapting to the digital age. This transformation has not only propelled many organisations into the digital space but has also proven to be an advantageous shift for those that embrace it.

Companies already invested in digitisation are doubling down on their efforts, while those that fail to enter this evolving landscape risk significant losses, ultimately jeopardising their competitiveness and market relevance.

Outlook for mid-market businesses in 2025
As business leaders continue to adapt to these new realities, the economic environment they face remains a critical factor in determining long-term success. Mid-market enterprises will need to navigate a complex macroeconomic landscape shaped by inflationary pressures, interest rate dynamics, global supply chain recovery and the impact of conflict.

While inflation surged in recent years due to post-pandemic supply-demand imbalances and geopolitical tensions, 2025 is expected to bring more moderate inflationary pressures. For instance, Cebr forecasts interest rates will be significantly lower than those seen in recent years, which should provide some relief to businesses and enable more investment in capital projects, expansions and digital transformation initiatives.

However, since interest rates were raised to near-term highs, borrowing costs will remain above those witnessed over much of the last 15 years. Consequently, companies relying on loans for expansion must manage cash flow carefully to avoid overleveraging, especially in sectors with tighter margins.

Another critical issue that has stirred concern is the potential for a global recession, driven by a perceived slowdown in the US economy. Initially, this was linked to a softening labour market, but fears of a sustained downturn have now dampened. The performance of the US will continue to play a key role in shaping the landscape for businesses globally, particularly those in countries at risk of increased trade disruption under the new Trump presidency.

International supply chains, still recovering from the disruptions caused by the pandemic, remain under pressure. Uncertainty in the Middle East has reignited concerns about supply chain vulnerabilities. Disruptions in key markets could lead to delays in production or increased costs, especially for industries such as manufacturing, retail, and technology.

Despite these challenges, the growth outlook across major regions has been stronger in 2024 compared to 2023, with this upward trajectory expected to continue into 2025 and beyond.

Navigating economic pressures, supply chains and cybersecurity
The escalating concerns surrounding supply chain vulnerabilities are evident, with nearly half (45%) of businesses reporting that supply chain disruptions are a greater threat now than they were five years ago. The financial implications of these disruptions are significant.

A survey of 400 senior supply chain executives across eight countries by The Economist revealed that two-thirds of respondents reported revenue declines of between 6% and 20% due to supply chain issues in 2021.

Nevertheless, companies are being proactive when it comes to mitigating these risks. On average, businesses conduct supply chain audits three times per year, with 19% of organisations carrying out more than four audits annually. Companies with more diversified supply chains tend to be especially diligent, with 98% of them performing audits at least once a year.

In addition to supply chain vulnerabilities, businesses are increasingly concerned about the financial and operational impact of cyber attacks. More than half (54%) of the surveyed companies reported that cyber threats have become more severe over the past five years.

The reality of these risks is underscored by a Cebr study revealing that more than a third of UK businesses fell victim to fraudulent activities, cyber attacks or data leaks in the past year, resulting in costs of £11.3 billion to the retail sector alone.

There are some elements of supply-side risk that are more difficult for businesses to guard against. A particularly notable post-pandemic example relates to the labour market and the struggle for talent retention.
These concerns are particularly prevalent in the UK and Germany, where 31% and 27% of businesses, respectively, report that their ability to retain talent has worsened since 2019. As companies continue to adapt their operations and invest in technology, addressing workforce challenges will likely remain a priority.

AI as a driver of innovation and efficiency
Amid the challenges of recent years, businesses have also been presented with significant opportunities. Perhaps the most prominent of these is AI.

While some organisations have hesitated to fully embrace AI, those that fail to do so risk missing out on one of the most transformative tools available today. Awareness of this is growing, with 77% of businesses reporting an increase in AI investment or usage over the past four years.

For larger businesses, the average annual AI investment has reached $1.5 million, highlighting a strong commitment to the technology’s potential. Despite these significant investments, many of the anticipated benefits of AI have yet to be fully realised.

The impact of AI will vary across sectors. Industries like IT and finance will be among the strongest gainers and can expect to generate substantial productivity improvements. In contrast, sectors reliant on human-centric tasks, such as healthcare or hospitality, may face challenges in fully integrating AI into their operations.

This variation highlights the complexity of AI adoption and the uncertainty surrounding its long-term impact.

Nevertheless, a majority (56%) of businesses view AI as a positive force for their organisation, more than double those that view it as a potential threat. This clear majority underscores the growing recognition of AI’s ability to drive innovation, boost efficiency and, ultimately, transform industries.

As businesses continue to navigate the uncertainties of AI, those that invest strategically and embrace the technology will be better equipped to harness its full potential. Arguably, AI is not just a tool for the future, but a driver of success in the present.

The future of business: resilience, sustainability, and technological foresight
As businesses navigate the evolving environment, success will favour those that are adaptable, forward-thinking, and committed to sustainability. Hybrid working, e-commerce and AI are not mere trends but opportunities to boost efficiency and innovation.

Yet, challenges remain. Supply chain disruptions, cybersecurity threats and economic uncertainties continue to exert pressure. Companies that proactively manage these risks while staying ahead of regulatory changes will be better positioned to thrive.

By converging risk management, ESG principles and technological adoption, businesses can build resilience and unlock new opportunities. Ultimately, those that balance innovation with responsibility will lead the future.
