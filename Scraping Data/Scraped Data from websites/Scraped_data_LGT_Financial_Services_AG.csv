You can prevent the use of marketing cookies by not selecting “Marketing” in the “Cookie information” pop-up that appears when you visit our Website and clicking on “Save and close”. 
3.3.1 LinkedIn
We use conversion tracking on our Website with the LinkedIn Insight Tag, a tool provided by LinkedIn Ireland, Wilton Plaza, Wilton Place, Dublin 2, Ireland.  
For this purpose, the LinkedIn Insight Tag is integrated on our pages and is placed as a cookie on the end device of the Visitor by LinkedIn. This informs LinkedIn that the Visitor has visited our Website. The IP address is also collected in this process. Moreover, timestamps and events such as site views are stored. This allows the statistical analysis of website use in order to optimize use of our Website. As a result, for example, we learn via which LinkedIn ad or interaction on LinkedIn a Visitor came to our Website.  
The data may be stored and processed by LinkedIn, such that a connection to the respective user profile is possible and LinkedIn can use the data for its own advertising purposes. 
3.3.2 Facebook and Instagram
We use Facebook Pixel to display our personalized advertising on the Facebook and Instagram platforms. Facebook and Instagram are operated by Meta Platforms Ireland Limited, 4 Grand Central Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland. 
To this end, information about user activity on our Website and further specific personal data (such as Pixel ID and the Facebook cookie) are sent to Facebook using Pixel. In particular, this information also includes http headers and click data. This allows interest-based advertising to be displayed to Visitors of our Website when visiting the social network Facebook or Instagram or other websites which likewise use this function. 
The browser establishes a direct connection with the Facebook server due to the marketing tools used. We have no influence on the scope and further use of data that are collected by Facebook through the use of Pixel. By integrating Facebook Custom Audiences, Facebook is informed that a Visitor has accessed one of our corresponding online offers or has clicked on one of our ads. Insofar as the respective Visitor is registered with one of the Facebook services, Facebook is able to assign the visit to the respective account. Even if a Visitor is not registered or logged in on Facebook or Instagram, it is possible that the provider gains knowledge of and stores the IP address and other identifying information. Facebook Pixel enables the measurement, analysis, and optimization of the effectiveness of Facebook ads for statistical purposes and the purposes of market research. We only receive reports from Facebook in anonymized form. 
3.3.3 X
We have integrated the remarketing function of the short messaging service X Corp., 1355 Market Street, Suite 900, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA on our Website.
This function enables us to target Visitors with interest-based advertising on the X platform. X uses tags for this purpose. Visits to our Website as well as data on use (e.g. all interactions with respect to the advertising displayed, clicks on links, retweets or likes) are collected in pseudonymous, not personal form using this tag. If a Visitor subsequently visits X, they will be shown advertising based on their interests. As a result, X is informed that our Website has been accessed from the end device of the Visitor. If the Visitor is registered with a X service, X is able to assign the visit to an account. Even if a Visitor is not registered or logged in on X, it is possible that the provider gains knowledge of and stores the IP address and other identifying information. The information generated by the tags on the use of our services is sent to a X server in the USA, where it is stored. 
3.3.4 Google
Google Analytics Remarketing 
We use the functions of Google Analytics Remarketing on our Website in conjunction with the cross-platform functions of Google Ads. The provider is Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. 
This function enables the advertising target groups defined with Google Analytics Remarketing to be combined with the cross-platform functions of Google Ads. As a result, depending on the previous usage and surfing behavior of a Visitor using an end device, interest-based, personalized advertising can also be displayed on another end device of the Visitor. Where relevant consent is provided, Google combines the web and app browser history with the Google account of the Visitor for this purpose. In this way, the same personalized advertising can be displayed on any end device on which the Visitor is logged in with their Google account. To support this function, Google Analytics collects Google-authenticated IDs, which are temporarily linked with our Google Analytics data in order to define and create target groups for cross-platform advertising. 
Google Ads and Google Conversion Tracking 
This is the online advertising program of Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States. 
We use conversion tracking in connection with Google Ads. When an ad placed by Google is clicked, a cookie for conversion tracking is placed on the end device of the Visitor via the Internet browser. When visiting certain pages of our Website, Google recognizes that the Visitor has clicked on the ad and was redirected to this page. The information collected with the help of the conversion cookie is used for our conversion statistics (e.g. total number of Visitors who clicked on our ad and were redirected to a page featuring a conversion tracking tag). 
Google DoubleClick 
DoubleClick by Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States uses cookies to place ads relevant for visitors, to improve reports on campaign performance or to prevent a Visitor from seeing the same ads on multiple occasions. Google uses a cookie ID to learn which ads are placed in which browser and can thereby prevent the ads from being displayed multiple times. Using cookie IDs, DoubleClick is also able to collect conversions that relate to ad requests. According to Google, DoubleClick does not collect any personal information. 
Your browser automatically establishes a direct connection with the Google server due to the marketing tools used. We have no influence on the scope and further use of the data that Google collects with the use of this tool; we therefore inform you according to the best of our knowledge. As a result of the integration of DoubleClick, Google is informed that you have accessed the relevant part of our Website or clicked on our ads. If you are registered with a Google service, Google is able to assign the visit to your account. Even if you are not registered or logged in with Google, it is possible that the provider gains knowledge of and stores your IP address. 
Google Marketing Platform
The online marketing tool Google Marketing Platform (""GMP"") uses cookies to serve ads that are relevant to users, to improve campaign performance reports, or to prevent a user from seeing the same ads more than once. Using a Cookie ID, Google records which ads are served in which browser and can thus prevent them from being displayed more than once.
In addition, GMP can use cookie IDs to record so-called conversions, i.e. whether a user sees a GMP ad and later calls up the advertiser's website and makes a purchase there.
Your browser automatically establishes a direct connection with Google's server. We have no influence on the scope and further use of the data collected by Google through the use of this service. According to Google, by integrating GMP, Google receives the information that you have called up the relevant part of our websites or clicked on an advertisement from us. If you are registered with a Google service, Google can assign the visit to your user account. Even if you are not registered with Google or have not logged in, there is a possibility that the provider may obtain and store your IP address. The use of GMP may also result in the transmission of personal data to Google's servers in the USA.
You can find more information about GMP on the Google Marketing Platform website.
4. External media - Incorporation of third-party services and contents
Third-party content and services may be incorporated into the Website (known as externally embedded components or plugins/widgets). These always require that the Third-party Providers of such content use Visitors’ IP addresses, as no content can be sent to the Visitor's browser without the IP address. 
We have no control over the amount of information that these Third-party Providers collect by means of the button or as a result of your use of pages that incorporate certain third-party services. If you use the services of Third-party Providers, the responsibility for the further processing of data lies with the respective third-party provider. 
On the Website, we use the following third-party products for these purposes: (for further information, see also sections 4.1 to 4.3)

LGT was founded in 1921 in Liechtenstein, where we still have strong roots to this day. In the space of a century, we have become one of the world's leading international private banks for high net worth clients and families. We manage assets of more than CHF 367.5 billion. Our largest client, the Princely House of Liechtenstein, is also our owner. We do business according to the same principles that the Princely Family holds dear: respect, friendliness, entrepreneurial commitment, a long-term and holistic perspective, and the relentless pursuit of quality and improvement. The results speak for themselves: Moody's and Standard & Poor's rate our creditworthiness as first-class - thanks to our strong balance sheet, high liquidity, and solid capitalization.  
Facts, facts, and more facts
Sometimes numbers speak louder than words
Our long-term perspective and risk-conscious approach are major selling points for new clients, especially - but not only - in times of economic and geopolitical turbulence. As an international private bank, we appeal to clients who are looking for a reliable and trustworthy partner to take care of their financial affairs. Our tradition of innovation and access to exclusive investment opportunities also make our service offering interesting to entrepreneurs and active investors.

Investing successfully with LGT Private Banking
Our 100-year history has taught us that there is such a thing as a recipe for success. And one of the key ingredients is our owner family’s experience as an entrepreneur, which spans several centuries. It is this experience that has led to our conviction that traditional values such as reliability, a long-term perspective, mutual trust and commitment are just as important for a company as being open to new things, embracing innovation, looking to the future, not being afraid of risk and seizing opportunities when they come knocking. These are the principles we follow as a company. We also apply them in the advice we provide and the services and products we offer. Our excellent results in recent years speak for themselves:

About LGT
Sponsorship at LGT
A shared commitment to art, culture and sport
Successful artists and elite athletes have three values in common - ones which have been close to our heart in our investment and finance business for decades: ambition, skill and passion. That is why we promote culture, such as art and classical music, and sport here at LGT Sponsorship. We support young musicians and emerging and elite athletes, and we work with the Princely Collections to make art accessible to all.
The Princely Collections
The princes of Liechtenstein have been passionate art collectors for more than four hundred years. They began to promote the fine arts in the Baroque era - and still do so to this day. As ambitious and consistent collectors, they have built one of the world's most important private collections of European art. The more than 30 000 works include over 1 600 paintings and 700 sculptures. The Princely Collections include masterpieces from the early Renaissance through to Austrian Romanticism, alongside ivory pieces, enamelware, prints, furniture, pietra dura work, porcelain, ceremonial weapons, and tapestries that once adorned the family's castles and palaces.

LGT Young Soloists
The Princely House of Liechtenstein has a long tradition of supporting promising musicians. Princess Maria Josepha Hermengilde von Liechtenstein was a great patron of Joseph Haydn, who thanked her for her support by composing five masses in her honor. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart also composed a wind serenade for Prince Alois I von Liechtenstein.
We continue this tradition to this day, supporting young string musicians through LGT Sponsorship. The LGT Young Soloists are aged between 12 and 23 years. They perform together, learn from each other and gain valuable experience for their careers in large orchestras and as soloists. They were the first youth orchestra to record albums for the prestigious RCA Red Seal classical label.

Other LGT Sponsorship activities
In addition to visual arts and music, we also support innovative conferences and sports through our sponsorship program. In sport, we do not just focus on the elite; our partnerships also promote young talent and mass participation.

Curling
Curling is one of the oldest sports, sometimes referred to as ""chess on ice"". Skill and accuracy are more important than power and speed. LGT has sponsored major competitions, such as the annual European and World Championships, for over a decade.
Alpine skiing
Hanni Wenzel, Marco Büchel and Tina Weirather have numbered among the world's top skiers. To foster great talent in such a small country, LGT supports the Liechtenstein Ski Association's work with young talents. It also supports the sport at mass-participation level through its long-standing cooperation with Bergbahnen Malbun.

About LGT
Sustainability
Thinking about the future is part of our corporate culture
Thinking, acting and investing sustainably are fundamental parts of our DNA. Our owners, the Princely Family of Liechtenstein, recognised early on how important sustainability is for our environment, society and future. As a family-run and sustainably oriented private bank, we are committed to the Paris Climate Agreement, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and a sustainable financial sector.

Sustainable investment with LGT
As a sustainably oriented bank, we take our social and corporate responsibility very seriously.  We can make an important contribution to solving environmental and social problems and protecting the climate through our own investments and by providing responsible advice. We offer our private clients various options for making their investments more sustainable.
Sustainable investing
Invest in attractive assets and contribute to a more sustainable future at the same time.

In our ambitious sustainability strategy we have set ourselves clear and measurable targets that underline our commitment to sustainability, enabling us to work and do business even more responsibly.

Facts and figures
Net zero by 2030 - this is the ambitious target we have set ourselves. In order to achieve it, we are aligning all areas of the company with a view to sustainability. For many years, we have been working intensively to optimize our consulting, our range of products and services, and our operations in terms of sustainability. We have already achieved some milestones, as these figures from our Sustainability Report 2023 show. But that is just the beginning.

Coal and controversial weapons excluded
As a financial institution, we can use our investments to influence the economy to become more sustainable - for example, by withdrawing from the financing of socially and environmentally harmful activities by companies and organizations or by entering into an active dialog and exchange with them. This is because avoiding such investments increases the financing costs of those companies and organizations.  
As a sustainably oriented bank we avoid investments that involve significant environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks as a matter of principle. We also have strict exclusion criteria for coal and controversial weapons.
Directive
Controversial weapons exclusion policy
Since 2012, we have not invested in companies involved in the production and trade of controversial weapons such as landmines, cluster bombs and munitions, nuclear weapons, biological and chemical weapons, phosphorus bombs and uranium bombs.
Policy on the exclusion of controversial weapons
Directive
Thermal coal exclusion policy
We want to actively support the fight against climate change. With that in mind, we consistently exclude companies from our investment universe that are active in coal production and the generation of electricity from coal.
Policy on the exclusion of thermal coal
Sustainability-related disclosures
This is how we deal with sustainability risks
Sustainable investments also entail risks. These can be environmental, social or governance risks that affect the value of the investment. With our sustainability framework, we define sustainability risks, identify them at an early stage, and determine how to deal with them in the investment process.

Memberships and partnerships
We cannot master major challenges such as climate change, social inequality or political polarization on our own. That's why we cooperate and exchange ideas with organizations that share the same goals. Together we can do more and change the future.

About LGT
Our owner
A journey through 900 years of the Princely House of Liechtenstein
The history of the owner family of LGT has been closely connected with the country of Liechtenstein ever since Prince Karl I (1569 to 1627), the first Prince of Liechtenstein. Today, Liechtenstein is one of the most economically successful states in the world.
Show information
Show information
The Princely House of Liechtenstein has always been entrepreneurial. Acquiring and managing land was the backbone of the family business in earlier centuries. Later, the family diversified into other economic sectors. With skill, innovative spirit, long-term perspective, a great deal of discipline and a little bit of luck, the Princely House built up successful companies in various industries. Thanks to a smart diversification strategy, the family overcame numerous crises and setbacks, preserving its wealth over generations. To this day, it continues to emphasize diversification, with its company and investment portfolio ranging from agriculture and forestry to alternative energy production and successful financial institutions. 
Its values and traditions are as important to the Princely Family as they were nine centuries ago. These include respect, friendliness, entrepreneurial commitment, a long-term and holistic perspective, and the relentless pursuit of quality, innovation, and improvement. These values shape LGT as well.  
The members of the Princely Family are successful entrepreneurs. But they are also more than that. Many famous regents, diplomats, and officers, but also builders, philanthropists and art collectors bear the name Liechtenstein.  
The Princely House has experienced many ups and downs in its history – we strive to learn lessons from them for the future.
H.S.H. Prince Max von und zu Liechtenstein
Chairman LGT 
The princely companies
A broadly diversified portfolio of companies

""Preserving values for the next generation"" is a recurring theme in the history of the Princely Family of Liechtenstein. Today, in addition to LGT, the family's assets include agriculture and forestry in Austria, numerous properties, a production company for container seedlings, and the largest US hybrid rice producer. As disparate as these industries are, the companies share three characteristics: they are managed according to the family values, operate sustainably, and healthy growth is more important than making a quick profit.
Royal wine cellars of the Prince of Liechtenstein
Sophisticated wines: for centuries, the name of the Princely Family has been inseparably linked with viticulture in the northern Weinviertel (wine quarter) and Liechtenstein.
On viticulture

The Princely Collections
With expertise and passion
The foundation for the Princely Collections was laid by Prince Karl I, the first Prince of Liechtenstein. Over the past 500 years, the Princely House has assembled one of the most important private art collections in the world, with masterpieces ranging from the early Renaissance to Austrian Romanticism. It features works by Lucas Cranach the Elder, Frans Hals, Raphael, Rembrandt, Peter Paul Rubens, Anthonis van Dyck, Rudolf von Alt, Friedrich von Amerling and Ferdinand Georg Waldmüller. These masterpieces are open to the public in the Liechtenstein Garden Palace and the Liechtenstein City Palace in Vienna and are also regularly featured in exhibitions of prominent museums worldwide.
