Our Mission
Satisfy the needs of customers by providing excellent financial products and services, as well as the aspirations of their employees, supporting the strengthening of the communities where they operate and adding value to their shareholders permanently with a long-term sense.
Information
Mercantil Bank (Schweiz) AG is a bank and securities broker established in Zurich, Switzerland. It operates under the supervision of the “Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority” (FINMA) according to Swiss laws and regulations.
The Bank specializes in providing wealth management services to Private Banking clients.
Mercantil Bank (Schweiz) is a subsidiary of the Panamanian financial holding Mercantil Servicios Financieros Internacional S.A., a corporation with more than 90 years of successful trajectory in the Latin American market, with a wide range of financial services in Panama and a presence in 10 different countries in the Americas and Europe.
For Mercantil, its presence through Mercantil Bank (Schweiz) in Zurich, Switzerland – one of most important financial centres in the world – is an important step in its objective of providing Private Banking services to clients in the most important markets.
Switzerland is well-known for its political, economic, legal and social stability, which has resulted in the country becoming, after 250 years of banking history, one of the most important financial centres in the world.
The country maintains its autonomy and does not belong, nor does it participate in the economic and monetary space of the Euro Zone or the European Union. Its currency, the Swiss Franc, is considered one of the most stable currencies in the world.
Value Proposition
Mercantil Bank (Schweiz) customers with the profile and interest in receiving Private Banking treatment, will find products and services carefully selected and diligently delivered, responsibly and with high quality standards. Mutual trust and transparency are the mainstays for solid, lasting relationships with our clients. Fortunately, the pace of Private Banking allows us to deepen our understanding of each client, and to explain in detail our proposals and the uniqueness of our services, and to address any lingering doubts and questions. Each of our Relationship Managers brings a minimum of fifteen years of experience in the various areas of banking, and will make use of all resources available to adapt our proposals to our clients’ needs. Our standards of security, discretion and privacy are extremely high; in line with the traditions that characterise Swiss Private Banking; even when compared with other well-reputed jurisdictions.

Information
Mercantil Bank (Schweiz) AG is a bank and securities broker established in Zurich, Switzerland. It operates under the supervision of the “Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority” (FINMA) according to Swiss laws and regulations.
The Bank specializes in providing wealth management services to Private Banking clients.
Mercantil Bank (Schweiz) is a subsidiary of the Panamanian financial holding Mercantil Servicios Financieros Internacional S.A., a corporation with more than 90 years of successful trajectory in the Latin American market, with a wide range of financial services in Panama and a presence in 10 different countries in the Americas and Europe.
For Mercantil, its presence through Mercantil Bank (Schweiz) in Zurich, Switzerland – one of most important financial centres in the world – is an important step in its objective of providing Private Banking services to clients in the most important markets.
Switzerland is well-known for its political, economic, legal and social stability, which has resulted in the country becoming, after 250 years of banking history, one of the most important financial centres in the world.
The country maintains its autonomy and does not belong, nor does it participate in the economic and monetary space of the Euro Zone or the European Union. Its currency, the Swiss Franc, is considered one of the most stable currencies in the world.
Value Proposition
Mercantil Bank (Schweiz) customers with the profile and interest in receiving Private Banking treatment, will find products and services carefully selected and diligently delivered, responsibly and with high quality standards. Mutual trust and transparency are the mainstays for solid, lasting relationships with our clients. Fortunately, the pace of Private Banking allows us to deepen our understanding of each client, and to explain in detail our proposals and the uniqueness of our services, and to address any lingering doubts and questions. Each of our Relationship Managers brings a minimum of fifteen years of experience in the various areas of banking, and will make use of all resources available to adapt our proposals to our clients’ needs. Our standards of security, discretion and privacy are extremely high; in line with the traditions that characterise Swiss Private Banking; even when compared with other well-reputed jurisdictions.
