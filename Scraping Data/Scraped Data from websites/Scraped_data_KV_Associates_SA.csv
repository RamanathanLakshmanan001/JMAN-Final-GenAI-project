WHO WE ARE
Professionals in the field of planning and execution of wealth and business structuring solutions for local and international clients

Nearly 25 years of expertise
 Established in 1997, KV Associates S.A. emerges as a comprehensive solution for small businesses, startups, wealthy families, entrepreneurs and legal professionals seeking to protect, develop, consolidate and perpetuate their wealth.
With a deep understanding of the complexities that accompany financial and business management, we provide a comprehensive range of services including advisory, research, implementation, follow-up, and administration for business and wealth planning and structuring solutions.
Working closely and continuously with shareholders and their advisors, we analyze the feasibility and suitability of proposed strategies and develop the necessary frameworks for relevant solutions.
Through our extensive network of licensed providers, we facilitate the incorporation, domiciliation and comprehensive administration of corporate structures. This includes legal support, accounting, tax compliance and payroll services, both in Luxembourg (SPF, soparfi, securitization vehicles, SIF, etc.) and internationally, covering Europe (England, Ireland, Netherlands, Portugal, etc.) and beyond (United States, Hong Kong, Singapore, Mauritius, etc.).
Our licensed status in real estate activities (agent, developer, administrator, and manager) enables us to manage projects in this sector proficiently. Additionally, we support clients with occasional transactions tailored to specific objectives.
