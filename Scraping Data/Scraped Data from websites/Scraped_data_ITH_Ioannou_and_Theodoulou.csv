Privacy Policy
  ITH is dedicated to protecting the confidentiality and privacy of information entrusted to it. As part of this fundamental obligation, ITH is committed to the appropriate protection and use of personal information (sometimes referred to as Personal Data) that we collect online about you. Generally, our intent is to collect only the Personal Data that you as online visitor have provided voluntarily so that we can offer information, offer or deliver services to you or offer information about employment opportunities. Please review this privacy statement to learn more about how we collect, use, share and protect the Personal Data that we have obtained.
  1. Collection and use of personal information
  1.1 What information we collect
We obtain Personal Data about you if you choose to provide it — for example, to contact mailboxes.
Any Personal Data you wish to provide, is not used for other purposes, than the purpose you originally provided the information to us. If for example, you wish to apply online for a job position with ITH and you decide to send us a resume or curriculum vitae (CV), we will use it to match you with any available job opportunities.
By registering and/or submitting personal information to ITH, you are also acknowledging that ITH may use this information in accordance with this Privacy Statement. Your personal information is not used for other purposes, unless we obtain your permission, or unless otherwise required or permitted by law or professional standards.
ITH only collects “sensitive” personal information when the relevant individuals voluntarily provide us with this information or where such information is required or permitted to be collected by law or professional standards. Sensitive information includes personal information regarding a person’s race, ethnicity, political beliefs, trade union membership, religious or similar beliefs, physical or mental health, sexual life or criminal record. Please use your discretion when providing sensitive Personal Data to ITH, and under any circumstances, do not provide sensitive Personal Data to ITH, unless you thereby consent to ITH’s use of that information for its legitimate business purposes and consent to the transfer and storage of such information to and in the company’s databases. If you have any questions about whether the provision of sensitive information to ITH is, or may be, necessary or appropriate for particular purposes, please contact us at info@ith.com.cy
  1.2 Cookies
Cookies may be placed on your computer or internet-enabled device whenever you visit us online. This allows the site to remember your computer or device and serves a number of purposes.
On some of our web sites, a notification banner will appear requiring your consent to collect cookies. If you do not provide consent, your computer or internet-enabled device will not be tracked for marketing-related activities. A secondary type of cookie referred to as “user-input” cookies may still be required for necessary functionality. Such cookies will not be blocked through the use of this notification banner. Your selection will be saved in a cookie and is valid for a period of 90 days. If you wish to revoke your selection, you may do so by clearing your browser’s cookies.
Although most browsers automatically accept cookies, you can choose whether or not to accept cookies via your browser’s settings (often found in your browser’s Tools or Preferences menu). You may also delete cookies from your device at any time. However, please be aware that if you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to fully experience some of our web sites’ features.
Further information about managing cookies can be found in your browser’s help file or through sites such as www.allaboutcookies.org.
Cookies by themselves do not tell us your email address or otherwise identify you personally. In our analytical reports, we may obtain other identifiers including IP addresses, but this is for the purpose of identifying the number of unique visitors to our websites and geographic origin of visitor trends, and not to identify individual visitors.
  Google Analytics
ITH uses Google Analytics. More information about how Google Analytics is used by ITH can be found here: http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html
To provide website visitors with more choice on how their data is collected by Google Analytics, Google have developed the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on. The add-on communicates with the Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js) to indicate that information about the website visit should not be sent to Google Analytics. The Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on does not prevent information from being sent to the website itself or to other web analytics services.
  2. Sharing and transfer of Personal Data
2.1 Tranfer to third parties
We do not share personal information with unaffiliated third parties, except as necessary for our legitimate professional and business needs, to execute your requests, and/or as required or permitted by law, professional standards or quality rules.
ITH may also disclose personal information in order to respond to requests of courts, government or law enforcement agencies or where it is necessary or prudent to comply with applicable laws. These disclosures may also be needed for data privacy or security audits and/or to investigate or respond to a complaint or security threat. ITH does not sell Personal Data to any third parties. Also, ITH will not transfer the Personal Data you provide to any third parties for their own direct marketing use.
  3. Choices
In general, you are not required to submit any personal information to ITH online, but we may require you to provide certain personal information in order for you to receive additional information about our services and events. ITH may also ask for your permission for certain uses of your personal information, and you can agree to or decline those uses. If you opt-in for particular services or communications, such as an e-newsletter, you will be able to unsubscribe at any time by following the instructions included in each communication. If you decide to unsubscribe from a service or communication, we will try to remove your information promptly, although we may require additional information before we can process your request.

ITH is committed to protecting the online privacy of your personal data. If you have questions or comments about our administration of your personal data, please contact us at info@ith.com.cy. You may also use this address to communicate any concerns you may have regarding compliance with our Privacy Statement.
