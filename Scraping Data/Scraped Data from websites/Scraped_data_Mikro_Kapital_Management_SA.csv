We use your personal data on the base of legal grounds provided in the GDPR:
based on your consent (Art. 6, Par. 1a GDPR);
to fulfil contractual or pre-contractual obligations (Art. 6, Par. 1b GDPR);
based on legal and/or regulatory requirements (Art. 6, Par. 1c GDPR);
to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person (Art. 6, Par. 1d GDPR);
based on public interest (Art. 6, Par. 1e GDPR);
legitimate interest (Art. 6, Par. 1f GDPR).
We process your data in order to provide you,  inter alia, with such services as management of securitization undertakings, micro- and impact financing, development of access economy or to contact you concerning events, newsletters and other marketing material that we think may be of interest for you. We may also use personal data to develop our website and services and to measure the effectiveness of our marketing. Our firm may use your personal data as part of a marketing campaign or market research. The processing of your data for this purpose is legal as long as it falls under out legitimate business interest as an securitization undertakings management company. You may object or opt-out of receiving marketing messages at any time. Furthermore, where required by applicable law, your prior consent will be obtained before sending you direct marketing.
2. HOW DO WE COLLECT/KEEP/PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL DATA?
There are several ways to collect your personal information:
you could directly send it to us either in electronic or hardcopy;
when the business relation with you starts, when you request an offer, when you receive a business proposal, when we realize a project for you or when you send your application (spontaneously or in reply to an announcement) for a role in our firm;
we may receive your data from external sources, such as public databases, websites, social networks and third parties for keeping the contact details and professional information we already hold for you accurate and up to date using publicly available sources
Personal data shall be kept in an appropriate form, allowing your identification for no longer than is necessary for the business purposes of our firm. We maintain appropriate organizational, physical and technical security measures (including personnel trainings, hardware and software, storage and access controls, monitoring and logging, vulnerability and breach detection, incident response) to protect personal data against unauthorized or accidental access, disclosure or destruction.
3. WHAT PERSONAL DATA ARE PROCESSED?

It is important to specify that your personal data may be transferred inside and outside the European Union (the “ EU”). The level of information protection in countries outside the EU may be less than that offered by GDPR. Where this is the case, we will implement appropriate measures to ensure that your personal information remains protected and secure in accordance with applicable data protection laws. EU standard contractual clauses are in place between all companies of Mikro Kapital that share and process personal data.

WHAT WE DO
Mikro Kapital, focused on impact finance and microfinance, operates through its Luxembourg securitization fund collecting financial resources from European Institutional and Private Investors through the issuance of fixed coupon, fixed maturity debt securities linked to the risks related to micro-financing.
The securitization fund invests the proceeds in its own local Portfolio companies, in emerging countries in Europe, Central Asia and APAC region, which provide micro credits, micro loans and access to sharing economy solutions to MSMEs to support their development and generating a positive impact on local communities.
At the same time Mikro Kapital offers a very interesting opportunity for investors to diversify their portfolio by investing in real economy sectors, which are flourishing thanks to the enthusiasm of their managers and largely unaffected by the volatility of the financial market.
Over 16 years of activity, in a historical period marked by exceptional turbulence on the financial markets, the default rate on the credit awarded has been average below 1%, at Portfolio Companies level, which has led to a remarkable Risk/Reward.

Back to the real small business, to support great ideas.
Home Impact FinanceMicrofinance
MICROFINANCE
Microfinancing to micro and small entrepreneurs (MSMEs) is not a new concept: small microcredit operations have existed since the 18th century.
Microfinance is a type of financing service that is provided to low-income individuals or groups who would otherwise have no access to financial services.
Ultimately, the goal of microfinance is to give low-income people an opportunity.
The global market for Microfinance estimated at US$157 Billion in the year 2020, is projected to reach a revised size of US$342 Billion by 2027, growing at a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 11.8% over the period 2020-2027.
According to the World Bank, MSMEs account for more than 90% of the total number of formal firms worldwide, thus representing the backbone of the global economy. Two out of three full-time jobs in developing economies are provided by MSMEs.
