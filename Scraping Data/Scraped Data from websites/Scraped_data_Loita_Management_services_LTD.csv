About Us
Loita derives its name from the Loita Naimina Enkio Forest in Kenya, a beautiful indigenous forest preserved by the local Maasai community. Importantly, many of Kenya’s early independence struggles were launched from the forest and thus it still stands for us today a symbol of a rich, emerging Africa.

Founded in 1992 by a group of international bankers originally in Kenya, the Loita Group has since grown into a unique pan-African group, headquartered out of Mauritius, with a dedicated team of professionals from around the world. In 2005 and 2006, Loita was voted by Africa Investor magazine as the best Financial Consultancy to Africa. The group originates and completes transactions across Africa from a network of company and affiliated locations and relies on this local network to share and apply best practices, which take into account the reality and demands of our markets.
The group has four distinct pillars of business operations, all of which centre around services to banking institutions, financial services or microfinance institutions: Corporate Finance advisory work and Bank Management; Electronic Funds Transfer Switches for countries banking sectors; Electronic Funds Services for banking institutions continent-wide and Financial Services Management.
Vision
 At Loita, we have created the optimum environment from which to originate and structure innovative solutions to those requirements.
Our competitive advantage derives from the ability to bridge the gap between the objectives of regional and international financial institutions and Africa's investment banking requirements.
Principles
Provide innovative products and services which accurately reflect the emerging markets in which it operates
Develop an outstanding cadre of African professionals who have an appreciable stake in the success of the company
Originate cutting-edge practices and technologies which contribute the rapid growth of African economies
Support private sector initiatives in Africa through greater access to credit and capital as Mauritius

Loita Transaction Services (LXS)
LXS supports the group subsidiaries involved in the automation of transactions and applications of increasingly sophisticated card technologies. LXS was created in late 2001 and has established fully operational Electronic Funds Transfer and switching businesses in Zimbabwe, Kenya and Zambia – “The Switch” - along with the requisite support infrastructure and services. Key to the positioning of any successful electronic banking switching, clearing and settlement Company, is its relationships with the central banks and banks in the respective countries in which it operates. Loita, and its group companies, have successfully invested in this area and have set up businesses which require negotiation, investment and development of relationships with local, international and the central bank in the particular region.
LXS has invested in the hardware, software, implementation and maintenance of the processing of The Switches. These switches act as payment hubs from the customer end-user with his/her card, the merchant or ATM machine or other, the transaction and the bank which is effecting the payment. The software used is both proprietary and third party which enables LXS to provide tailor-made solutions to each country and its specificities. LXS has designed, implemented and now manages these electronic transaction & payment processing systems in sometimes the most difficult environments which all lends to the overall group experience in this business practice.
Through LXS's two core divisions; EFT CORP and the Pan African switching businesses:
LXS is positioned to bring together the most advanced technology capabilities within the group, whilst making use of the coordination and synergistic relationships between these companies and becoming the market leader in developing, and providing advanced products to the Pan - African market,
LXS objective is to bring advanced technologies not only to the large banking and non-Banking customer but also to the SMEs. In doing so, whole segments of the African customer base, mostly under-served by the large banks, will benefit. LXS prides itself in possessing extensive expertise in financial and banking payment systems, as well as skills in systems integration for complex and large projects.
Consulting
Switching
Electronic banking is widely anticipated to be the next technology explosion on the continent after cellular telephone technology. Electronic Funds Transfers and Payments have been the key to the growth of Electronic Banking in Africa over the past few years.
