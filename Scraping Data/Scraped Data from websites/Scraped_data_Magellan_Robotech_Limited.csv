These are things we do to help us operate as a commercial organisation. If we make decisions based on these grounds, then you have a right to object.

What legal Safeguards apply in protecting personal Information?
To ensure transparency and commitment to lawful processing of your personal data, we apply the following principles as prescribed by law:
Consent
In certain situations we collect and process your information with your consent.  An example of this is where you have opted into receiving direct marketing from us.
Contractual Obligations
We sometimes collect information from you to perform our duties under a contract. An example of this would be when you enter into a contract of employment with us to process your monthly pay. Another example is when you sign up to an account for one of our services and accept our terms and conditions.

This information is processed to enable us to comply with any legal or regulatory requirements as determined by Gambling Regulatory Bodies, which regulate the gambling business.
What are your rights?
Below is an overview of your rights in relation to your personal information that we process.
To protect the confidentiality of your information, we will ask you to verify your identity before proceeding with any request you make under this Privacy Notice. If you have authorised a third party to submit a request on your behalf, we will ask them to prove they have your permission to act.
If you need to contact us in relation to any request you wish to make under your data subject rights, you can do this by emailing or writing to the Data Protection Liaison Office (contact details are listed towards the end of this privacy policy).
Right of Access (Subject Access)
You have the right to obtain confirmation that your personal information is being processed, how and why it is being processed, and access to your personal information. If you would like to request a copy of the personal information we hold about you, you should contact the Data Protection Liaison Office. We will ask you to complete and return a form. This is not compulsory but helps us to identify you to provide the information you are looking for.
Right to Rectification
You have the right to have inaccurate personal information rectified. If you cannot amend any inaccuracies yourself through your on-line account for example, your request will be reviewed and where we can, we will update any inaccuracies. If, however, we take the decision not to make a change you have requested, we will explain this to you in writing.
Right to Erasure
This is sometimes referred to as ‘the right to be forgotten’. You have the right to have your personal information erased if:
The personal information is no longer necessary for the purpose which we originally collected or processed it for;
You gave your consent to the processing in the first place and you withdraw your consent and we have no other legal basis to rely upon to process the information;
Your request will be looked at and where we can we will erase the personal information requested. If however we take the decision not to comply with the request as we have a lawful basis to continue the processing, we will explain this to you in writing.
Right to Restrict Processing
You have the right to restrict the processing of your personal information in certain circumstances. This could be because you have issues with the content of the information we hold or how we have processed your information at a certain time. Your request will be looked at and where we can comply with the request we will and for the duration of the restriction time scale you have indicated. If however we take the decision not to comply with the request, we will explain this to you in writing.
Right to Data Portability
The right to data portability only applies:
to personal data you have provided to us;
where the processing is based on your consent or for the performance of a contract; and
when processing is carried out by automated means.
If you meet the above criteria and still would like to make a request, you will need to do this in writing as stated above and we will provide you with information in an appropriate file. In the future it may become possible to transfer your information directly to another provider. It is unlikely that we will be able to do this at the present time but we will try to accommodate requests where we can.
Right to object
You have the right to object to:
processing based on legitimate interests or the performance of a task in the public interest/exercise of official authority (including profiling);
direct marketing (including profiling); and processing for purposes of scientific/historical research and statistics.
Your request will be reviewed and where we can comply with the request we will. If we take the decision not to comply with the request, we will explain this to you in writing
How long will we keep your personal information?
Whenever we collect or process your personal information, we’ll only keep it for as long as is necessary for the purpose for which it was collected. At the end of the retention period, your information will be permanently and securely deleted.
Some examples of our retention periods are below;
If you use our live chat service, your information is retained for a period of two years in the live system after which time it is archived and permanently and securely deleted after 5 years.
All images captured on any of our CCTV are kept for a period of between 7 and 30 days after which time the images are overwritten.
If you make a complaint and the complaint is escalated through our complaints procedure, we will keep all information in relation to the complaint for 3 years after the issue has been closed.
When the bet-booking service is used, the personal data collected – including video recording – are processed exclusively for the purpose of managing the bet proposal, and are immediately cancelled as soon as the bet is accepted or the bet-booking proposal is rejected.
To fulfil our requirements, some of your personal information will need to be retained for a period of time after you cease to be a customer. When we no longer need it to fulfil the above requirements, we delete it securely.
Who do we share your personal information with?
Regulators/Law Enforcement agencies and other authorities
Some of your personal information may have to be shared with appropriate Gambling Regulatory bodies, such as: ADM (Italy), MGA (Malta), BGC (Belgium), NBA (Cyprus), DGA (Denmark) and the Gambling Commission (UK), as well as the Advertising Standards Authority, Independent Betting Adjudication Service and the Information Commissioners, located in each of the associated countries.
Data can also be disclosed to:
(i) operators and fellow members of suspicious betting activity detection platforms (currently Stanleybet reports only to the IBIA platform and accordingly IBIA and all of its members will have access to and process all suspicious betting activity alerts Stanleybet might raise and might report such data themselves to other interested parties, such as those noted in the remainder of this clause);
(ii) gambling regulators;
(iii) police and prosecuting authorities (for prosecution of offenders);
(iv) sports governing bodies (for example, ITIA for Tennis).
In most circumstances, we will not disclose your personal information, unless you have given consent or we are allowed to or required to do so by law. However, when we investigate a complaint, for example, we may need to share personal information with the organisation concerned and with other relevant bodies.
Credit Reference Agencies/Identity Verification Agencies
We may need to conduct verification checks which could include sharing information with third party organisations, such as credit reference agencies, sanctions check services.
Shop Agent indicated
In case of use of the bet-booking service, your personal data (including the video recording with instructions) will be transmitted to the shop agent indicated by you and immediately cancelled as soon as the bet is accepted or the bet-booking proposal is rejected.
Overseas transfers of your information
Your personal information may be processed in any country in which we and/or our data processors have facilities. Where your personal information is sent to a country outside of the European Economic Area (EEA), by using the service, you are consenting for such a transfer to take place. We will ensure that adequate measures are in place to protect your information and to treat it as securely as it would have been had it remained in the EEA. If of course, you are not happy with any of your personal information being processed outside of EEA, you must let us know immediately in writing.
Role of the Data Protection Regulators
Each European Member State has its own designated Data Protection Regulator responsible for upholding the information rights in the public interest. This includes investigating reported data breaches and providing guidance and assistance to individuals as to their rights. Where a data controller identifies a breach it shall be solely responsible for determining and notifying the most suitable Data Protection Regulator within the EU Member States.
Contacting the Regulator
If after contacting us, you remain unhappy about how we handle your personal data, customers located in the United Kingdom may contact the Information Commissioners Office, Wycliffe House, Water Lane, Wilmslow, Cheshire, SK9 5AF or visit https://ico.org.uk/.
Please Note:
This Privacy Notice was last updated in March 2021 and will be updated from time to time if any changes are made that could affect you.
