Employment Licenses
Single-Work Permit
Third-Country Nationals (TCNs) who wish to work and reside in Malta for longer than six (6) months must submit a Single Work Permit application (i.e., CEA Form C) along with the required supporting documentation. The Single Work Permit application combines two procedures: obtaining a work permit and an e-residence card, thereby granting temporary residence based on employment in Malta.
A Single Work Permit is specifically issued for TCNs employed by a designated employer to perform a particular full-time job in Malta. As such, the permit is not transferable, meaning the employee cannot use it to take up a different job or work for another employer, even on a part-time basis. Generally, employment licenses are issued for a maximum duration of one (1) year and may be renewed upon request.
It is important to note that Single Work Permit applications are typically subject to labor market assessments by the relevant authority. This assessment includes factors such as the national situation regarding surpluses or shortages in a specific occupation or sector, the employer’s recruitment and redundancy history, business investments, and contractual commitments.
Additionally, the skill level, relevant experience, and overall suitability of the TCN for the specific position will be taken into account during the application process.

Eligibility
Submission of application
Timeframe
Submission of application
Applications for a Single Work Permit can be submitted while the Third-Country National (TCN) is in Malta or by the prospective employer in Malta while the TCN is still abroad.
Among other required documentation, it is essential for the TCN applying for a Single Work Permit to possess the following:
One or more reference letters demonstrating at least three (3) years of experience relevant to the position indicated in the Single Work Permit application.
A contract of employment or a letter of intent signed by both the applicant and the prospective employer in Malta.
A complete list of the required supporting documentation can be found at the following links:
Checklist for TCN in Malta
Checklist for TCN abroad
Self-Employment License
For Third-Country Nationals (TCNs), a Self-Employment License is required and is granted only in exceptional cases.
Eligibility
To qualify for self-employed status, a Third-Country National must meet one or more of the following criteria:
Investment Requirement: Invest a minimum of €500,000 in Malta within six (6) months from the date the employment license is issued. This capital expenditure must exclusively consist of fixed assets (such as immovable property, plant, and machinery) used for business purposes as outlined in the business plan submitted with the application. Please note that rental contracts do not qualify. This expenditure must be substantiated by receipts in the TCN’s name. Additionally, the application must include a reference letter from a reputable Maltese bank, certifying that the TCN has the ability to raise such capital.
Business Plan Submission: A well-structured business plan must be submitted by highly skilled innovators who commit to recruiting at least three EEA/Swiss/Maltese Nationals within eighteen (18) months of establishment. This requirement is reserved for individuals who are (1) highly skilled (with qualification certificates of ISCED Level 6 or higher) and (2) establishing a highly innovative venture.
Project Approval: A person leading a project formally approved by Malta Enterprise and duly notified to Jobsplus may also qualify.
Applications that demonstrate a firm commitment to engaging EEA/Swiss/Maltese Nationals as part of the staffing complement will be favorably considered.
If the TCN intends to establish a company and apply as an employee (i.e., director/owner) of that company, the application must be submitted to the Department of Citizenship and Expatriate Affairs, which would entitle the applicant to a Single Work Permit (please refer to the previous section for further details).
Submission of application
Applications must be submitted to Jobsplus along with all required supporting documentation, which can be found in the document titled ‘ELU – FM – 005 New Employment Licence Application Checklist for a Third Country National’ at the following link:
https://jobsplus.gov.mt/resources/forms
Comprehensive information regarding the application process, including the processing and issuance of Employment Licenses, is available in the Employment Licence Guidelines on the Jobsplus website (www.jobsplus.gov.mt).
A non-refundable processing fee of €230 is due upon submission of the application.
Once an employment license is obtained, TCNs may relocate their family members to Malta, provided they can demonstrate adequate financial means to support each family member.
Timeframe
There is no standard timeframe for the issuance of a Self-Employment License; each case is evaluated individually, and the timeframe may vary accordingly.

About Malta
Malta: A Brief History
Malta, officially known as the Republic of Malta, is an island country located in the Mediterranean Sea, approximately 80 km south of Italy and 284 km east of Tunisia. It consists of an archipelago and is the world’s tenth-smallest country by area, with a population of about 542,000 living across 316 km².
The capital city, Valletta, is the smallest capital in the European Union by both area and population. Malta has been inhabited since around 5900 BC and has a rich history shaped by various civilisations, including the Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Greeks, Romans, Arabs, Normans, and the Knights Hospitaller, among others. It became a British colony in the early 19th century and played a crucial role during World War II. Malta gained independence in 1964 and established its current parliamentary republic in 1974. It joined the European Union in 2004 and adopted the euro in 2008.
The country’s artwork, music, cuisine, and architecture reflect a blend of influences due to its historical ties to Italy and neighbouring regions. With a significant portion of the population speaking Italian, Malta has nurtured a cultural heritage that includes deep-rooted ties to Catholicism, its state religion, while also upholding the freedom of religious practice.
Today, Malta boasts a developed high-income economy, with tourism being a key sector. The island attracts visitors and expatriates alike due to its warm climate, recreational areas, and remarkable historical monuments, including three UNESCO World Heritage Sites: Ħal Saflieni Hypogeum, Valletta, and several megalithic temples, which are among the oldest free-standing structures in the world.
Various individuals relocate to the tiny island state every year and are attracted to what Malta has to offer. Malta provides the ideal legal and business environment to extend your business practices and invest in an upcoming and luxurious property market. Above all, the island is perfect for relocating your family and retiring in tranquility- a characteristic Mediterranean climate, multilingual population, expansive history and culture and a bolstering economy.
Malta Real Estate
Over the past two decades, the real estate market in Malta has experienced significant growth, driven by increasing interest from both local and international investors. Following Malta’s accession to the European Union in 2004, the property sector gained momentum as foreign interest surged, particularly in residential and commercial properties. This growth has been further supported by the government’s various investment programmes, making it an attractive destination for expatriates and investors seeking residency or citizenship.
The real estate sector has also benefited from a stable political environment, a robust legal framework, and a flourishing economy. Prices have steadily increased, reflecting strong demand and limited supply in desirable locations, particularly in urban areas like Valletta and Sliema. Additionally, Malta’s luxurious and diverse property offerings, including modern apartments, traditional townhouses, and villas with stunning sea views, have placed the island on the map as a premier destination for those looking to invest in real estate. As the market continues to evolve, Malta remains poised for further growth, making it an opportune time for potential investors to explore the opportunities within its thriving real estate landscape.
Maltese Citizenship by Investment & Residence Programmes
Individuals interested in obtaining citizenship or residency in Malta can benefit from a variety of investment programmes offered by the Maltese Government. These programmes include:
Citizenship by Direct Investment Programme (ESDI)
Malta Permanent Residence Programme (MPRP)
Global Residence Programme (GRP)
Key Employment Initiative (KEI)
Malta Retirement Programme (MRP)
The Residence Programme (TRP)
Employment Licenses (Single Work Permit and Self-Employment)
Kyshen International has extensive experience managing applications under these programmes and possesses all necessary licenses to facilitate your application process.

The Residence Programme (TRP)
Beneficiaries of the Residence Programme will receive a residence permit, granting them special status by the Malta International Tax Unit (ITU). This status affords unique tax advantages that make relocating to Malta particularly appealing. Under this programme, individuals can benefit from a fixed tax rate of just 15% on income generated overseas and remitted to Malta, allowing for significant savings compared to many other jurisdictions.
This tax structure is designed to attract expatriates and investors, creating a favourable environment for those seeking to establish a new residence in Malta. The Residence Programme not only provides financial benefits but also opens the door to a high quality of life in a picturesque Mediterranean setting, with access to excellent amenities, vibrant culture, and a welcoming community. This makes it an attractive option for retirees, professionals, and families looking to enjoy the advantages of living in Malta.
