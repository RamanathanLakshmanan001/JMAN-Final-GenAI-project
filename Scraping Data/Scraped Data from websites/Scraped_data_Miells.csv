OUR COMMITMENT
01 Aug, 2022
PRODUCT SAFETY
By Tiffany Walker
You care about what goes into your products, and so do we. Every formula at Mielle is designed with your safety in mind, using high-quality ingredients and thorough testing to ensure they meet the highest standards. From sourcing to formulation, we take every step seriously so you can feel confident in every drop, cream, and curl.
TRIED & TESTED
Our #1 priority is to provide you with textured hair products with the highest standards of safety and quality you deserve.
Our award-winning Rosemary Mint products are now accredited by the Skin Health Alliance®, an independent not-for-profit, working globally alongside dermatologists, scientists, and industry – ensuring our products and formulas meet the highest scientific standards of skin safety.
Includes:
Rosemary Mint Scalp & Hair Strengthening Oil 
Rosemary Mint Strengthening Shampoo
Rosemary Mint Strengthening Conditioner
Rosemary Mint Strengthening Masque
Rosemary Mint Strengthening Leave-in Conditioner
Rosemary Mint Daily Styling Crème
Rosemary Mint Strengthening Edge Gel
OUR COMMITMENT TO YOU
Quality & Care in Every Product
We are dedicated to supporting your unique hair journey with products that prioritize quality, transparency, and integrity. Our commitment to you means using safe, effective ingredients and holding ourselves to the highest standards.
Every product is crafted with care and backed by rigorous testing to ensure it delivers the consistency and results you deserve. We are here to empower you with hair care that you can trust, every step of the way.
YOUR QUESTIONS, ANSWERED
We understand that recent questions about our products may have caused concern. Here are some answers to reassure you about our dedication to product quality & consistency:
What is our commitment to our community?
Mielle is dedicated to uplifting the Black community by expanding access to textured hair products and investing in meaningful community programs.
Since our founding in 2014, we’ve stayed true to the mission and values set by our Founder and CEO, Monique Rodriguez—a commitment we proudly uphold as part of the P&G Beauty family.
Our partnership with P&G Beauty empowers us to grow and reach more textured hair communities worldwide, sharing the high-quality products you know and trust.
We remain steadfast in our commitment to celebrate, care for, and empower Black women.
Has our Rosemary Mint Oil's formula changed?
No, Mielle’s two Rosemary Mint Oil formulas remain exactly as they were before our acquisition by P&G Beauty in March 2023.
Since its 2017 launch, Rosemary Mint Oil has been a trusted favorite, loved by millions—including our own Mielle team, who proudly share it with friends and family.
Is it normal to experience hair shed while using our products?
Hair shedding can feel alarming, but it’s actually a normal part of your hair’s natural cycle. According to the American Academy of Dermatology, it’s typical to lose 50 to 100 hairs a day. Factors like hormonal shifts, genetics, stress, nutrition, certain medications, and frequent styling can all increase shedding.
At Mielle, safety and quality are everything. Our Rosemary Mint Oil and Shampoo are dermatologically tested for skin safety with no signs of irritation, and they’re even tested for eye compatibility in case of accidental exposure. Each product undergoes rigorous internal and third-party testing to ensure they’re safe, effective, and ready for your hair journey.
While some concerns have circulated online, no negative experiences have been medically linked to our products. For any ongoing concerns, we encourage you to connect with a doctor or board-certified dermatologist for personalized guidance.
EXPLORE OUR STORY
LET'S GET TO THE ROOT OF IT
THE SCIENCE BEHIND OUR FORMULAS
Step inside our facility with Dr. Ashley, our Chemist & Education Manager, and Omer, our Scientist, as they share a behind-the-scenes look at how we bring each product to life
OUR PRODUCT SAFETY CRITERIA
We bring together the power of science, the richness of nature, and a deep understanding of textured hair to create high-quality, affordable products that truly support your hair journey.
Are Mielle products safe?
Yes. Based on our formulas and processes, our products are safe. Our products are created with healthy ingredients and are formulated to deliver safe and effective results. At Mielle, we strive to maintain the highest standards of safety, quality, and integrity in everything we do. All of our products undergo rigorous and frequent testing by both internal and third-party independent labs to ensure product safety and efficacy. We stand by the effectiveness of our formulations and the dedication that goes into making each product.
We understand there have been some concerns about whether our products have undergone formula changes since our acquisition, and we want to clear the air: we have not made any changes to the formulas of your favorite Mielle products since the P&G partnership in 2023.
Understanding how Mielle products are designed to nourish, not harm , your hair.
Since its launch in 2017, Rosemary Mint Oil has been loved by millions who use it and keep coming back, and it is trusted by our team. Mielle products are designed to nourish your hair. We constantly evaluate the quality of our products for compliance and safety. Our product development and manufacturing processes remain under strict quality control, and all ingredients are carefully sourced and tested to ensure they meet our high standards. We value the trust you’ve placed in us, and we are committed to putting your hair health first as we grow.
Why did Mielle partner with P&G Beauty?
Mielle’s partnership with P&G Beauty gives us an opportunity to serve more of the textured hair community with the great products and formulas they love. Our shared commitment is to grow and scale Mielle to further expand community access and investment. Mielle and P&G have each committed $10 million to Mielle Cares, a non-profit aimed at providing resources and support to advance education and economic opportunities in Black and Brown communities.

PROTECTING YOUR CURLS
Your trust is just as important to us as your hair. Counterfeit & diverted products have become a growing concern in the beauty industry, and if you have come across Mielle products on unauthorized websites, auction platforms, or discount stores, you have likely seen the issue firsthand.
Our goal is to give you the tools and information you need to shop confidently.

Google Ads and Analytics
. We use “Google Analytics” to collect information about the use of our Sites. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit the Sites, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to the Sites. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve our Sites. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to your device on the date you visit our Sites rather than your name or other personal information. We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with other personal information. Although Google Analytics plants a cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit our Sites, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to our Sites is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy. You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to the Sites by disabling cookies on your browser. Along with cookies, Google Analytics also uses electronic images known as web beacons (sometimes called single pixel gifs) to compile aggregated statistics to analyze how our Sites are used.

With the help of the Facebook pixel, we also want to ensure that our Facebook Ads correspond to the potential interest of users. The Facebook pixel also enables us to track the effectiveness of Facebook ads for statistical and market research purposes by seeing whether users are redirected to our website after clicking on a Facebook ad (known as a “conversion”). For more information, see Facebook’s privacy terms.

We Might As Well Be A Brand Rep!
4 months ago
We absolutely LOVE this product! I have 4 biracial children all with different curl patterns and hair textures and it works for ALL of them! My son, Malakai, uses it the most and we are constantly getting asked what hair product he uses because of his curls!! He models so it’s important we have our curls poppin’! I have actually persuaded many people to put products back in the store and try Mielle!! We might as well be Brand Reps! We love the products!! * Wouldn’t let me add images but happy to share images of his hair!
Yes, I recommend this product.

Just Like The Name, Butter!
4 months ago
I love this product! I use it in my hair to restore hydration during protective styles. Mostly for use in my 6 year old daughter’s hair for about 2-3 years now. It’s part of her daily hair routine. We have 2 completely different hair textures. Mine is more fine with a soft loose curl pattern. Hers is extremely thick with tight coily curls. The butter just melts into the hair and is so lightweight. I use it on wet and dry hair. The shine is impeccable. This product has helped me to continue to maintain a healthy hair journey for my child.
Yes, I recommend this product.

Soft But Defined Hold
9 months ago
I used this today under the brand’s defining hold custard. Both products worked together well. No flaking. I have very hard to define hair. I’m the original frizzy sister. This product combo held my spirals very well without a hard cast. I picked out the roots to invite fullness. Will definitely use again.
Yes, I recommend this product.

Very Good For Fine Frizzy Naturally Wavy Hairs!
rasnas
7 months ago
I have fine frizzy hair and have slight natural waves at the bottom. It’s very effective in taming the frizz and defining the curls. I was curious about cold application technology, so I kept this in refrigerator and I feel it made a difference. Also it is creamy yet lightweight, it did not weigh down my fine hairs which is perfect for my hair type!

Love this. My hair doesn’t feel too heavy and it helps keep the curl in my hair through the day. It also smells wonderful. I also didn’t notice any crazy frizz like other products I’ve used.

Smells Great, Makes Hair Feel Amazing!!! New Favorite Product Line!
3 months ago
Bought this about 2 weeks ago after seeing it on shelves in Winn Dixie Grocer, I pulled it up on Target App and was a better deal so I ordered the Leave In Conditioner and Curl Smoother. Have since added cleaning ingredients scalp oil and Edge fringe product. These products smell amazing and don't leave funky buildup. I try to have shampoo days as little as possible, and this doesn't make my hair dull. Each time I use, my hair gets shinier healthier and smells amazing. Def reccomend.
Yes, I recommend this product.

Endorsements, Reviews and Ratings
The below governs your conduct and obligations, and P&G's rights regarding Endorsements, Reviews and/or Ratings (hereafter “R&R”) of P&G product(s) and services (herein together referred to as “P&G products”) that you may submit on the P&G Sites.
Your Conduct & Obligations
When submitting a R&R you acknowledge and agree that:
your R&R is created and submitted by yourself, and made in good faith;
you are a genuine user of the P&G product at the time of your R&R which reflects your true and honest opinion;
you are at least 18 years old;
you, not P&G, are responsible for the contents of your R&R;
you release, hold harmless and indemnify on behalf of yourself and your successors, assigns and representatives, P&G and each of its respective officers, directors and employees from and against any and all claims, suits, actions, demands, liabilities and damages of any kind whatsoever arising out of or in connection with the use of your R&R, including, without limitation, any and all claims for false advertising, copyright infringement, invasion of privacy, violation of the right of publicity or of moral rights, and/or defamation.
you will not include in the R&R any information that could identify you or others (you may submit the R&R with your first name or a nick name, but you may not include any other personal data in the R&R);
Notwithstanding the above, we may require specific personal data for authentication purposes (e.g., your e-mail address), and to communicate with you regarding your R&R, however this authentication personal information will not be published with the R&R.
You further acknowledge and agree that:
you are not an employee of P&G nor do you work for an affiliate or agency of P&G hired by P&G to promote and/or sell P&G products; OR, if that is the case, you .include a clear and conspicuous disclosure of your relationship with P&G in your R&R;
your R&R is made without any prior payment or benefit or promise of payment or future benefit made to you (or the expectation by you of any payment or benefit in return for your proposed R&R); OR, if you will/do/did receive any payment or benefit, whether prior or after providing your R&R, you clearly disclose this fact as you provide your R&R and respect these Terms;•
Notwithstanding the above, there may be specific P&G promotional activities that involve R&R with additional terms applying.
You further acknowledge and agree that:
your R&R does not contain content that is false, misleading, offensive, obscene, hate speech, derogatory, defamatory, libelous, slanderous, or otherwise inappropriate; that infringes any third party’s right (such as, but not limited to, copyright, trademark rights);
your R&R does not include any content about other companies or their brands;
your R&R does not contain programming or materials containing any Trojan horses, viruses, worms, harmful code, or other potentially damaging information, programs, or file; OR any other content that otherwise violates any other law or regulation.
P&G’s rights
P&G does not guarantee that you will have any opportunity to edit or delete your R&R. Except for any personal data we may collect from you as part of the authentication process and as part of our personal data processes that you consent to or that are mandated by law, any R&R will be considered non-confidential and non-proprietary.
By submitting a R&R and agreeing to these Terms when you make your submission, you grant P&G, to the extent allowed under applicable law, a non-exclusive, worldwide, unlimited, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, fully sublicensable and transferable right and license to use, monitor, review, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish (including to third-party websites as so-called “syndicated” R&R), translate, create derivative works from, distribute, transmit, display, and perform your R&R in whole or in part, in any media, format or technology, online or offline, without any further notice or payment to or permission needed from you.
Any opinions expressed in the R&R are of the individual submitting this, and not of P&G. We neither endorse nor guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness or any such R&R.
Notwithstanding the above, P&G uses trusted third parties that monitor R&R before publication for purposes of authentication and compliance (including to prevent, detect and monitor fraudulent R&R) . Random monitoring checks are also executed from time to time for sampling purposes to verify compliance with these terms. Monitoring checks can be executed manually or automatically, through tags on the Site.
P&G reserves the right to
- refuse or remove R&R and/or withdraw access to a User if the R&R violates these Terms and/or applicable laws and regulations;
- remove personal data that may appear in the R&R for data protection purposes.

Third-Party Links
The Sites may contain links to other sites on the Internet that are owned and operated by third parties (the ""External Sites""). Even if the third party is affiliated with P&G, P&G has no control over these External Sites, all of which have separate privacy policies, data collection practices and terms and conditions independent of P&G. P&G has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies or actions and is not responsible for the privacy practices, the terms and conditions or the content of such web sites.

If you determine to share any information about any P&G products through a social network platform, including through links provided by P&G through the Site, you may be able to post such information directly to your profile at the social networking platform without leaving the Site. Some social networking platforms enable functionality that allows a user to receive and transmit data to the social networking platform through use of overlays or other technology. Although it may appear that the data is collected by P&G, the data is in fact collected directly by the social networking platform and/or a third-party service provider. Your use of a social network platform to share any information is subject to, and you must comply with, the terms, conditions and restrictions of that social network platform and/or of the third-party service provider.

Geographic Scope of Site and Product Claims
P&G controls and operates the Sites all round the world. Each claim or statement about the effectiveness of P&G products and/or each claim or statement comparing the effectiveness of P&G products to the effectiveness of other products is expressly limited to the Country where the Site making these claims or statements is published, unless otherwise disclosed on the Site. Unless otherwise specified in or by the Sites, the Sites are intended to promote only those P&G products that are sold by P&G in the Country where the Site is published, and P&G makes no representation that materials in its Sites or the products described thereby are appropriate or available for use in other locations.
Access to the Sites from territories where their content is illegal is prohibited. Those who choose to access the Sites from locations outside the Country where the Site is published do so on their own initiative and risk and are responsible for compliance with applicable local laws. You may not use or export the Content in violation of export laws and regulations of the Country where the Site is published.

Contents of the Site – Disclaimer
All Content of the Site and any materials made available through the Site are provided ""as is"" and without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. To the fullest extent permissible pursuant to applicable law, P&G disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to, all implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and non-infringement. P&G does not warrant or make any representations regarding the use or the results of the use of the materials in the Site in terms of its correctness, accuracy, reliability, or otherwise. The materials in the Site could include technical inaccuracies or typographical errors. These materials could be inaccurate or become inaccurate as a result of development occurring after their respective dates. P&G undertakes no obligation to verify or maintain the accuracy of such information. Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts, or the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, the above limitations may not apply to you.
Back to Top
Operation of the Site – Disclaimer
P&G endeavors to maintain the Site and its operation, but is not, and cannot be, responsible for the results of any defects that may exist in the Site or its operation. As to the operation of the Site, P&G expressly disclaims all warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to all implied warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, title and non-infringement. P&G makes no warranty that (i) the operation of the Site will meet the user’s requirements; (ii) access to the Site will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, free of viruses, worms, Trojan Horses or other harmful components, or free of defects or errors; (iii) the results that may be obtained from the use of the Site will be accurate or reliable; or (iv) defects will be corrected. You (and not P&G) assume the entire cost of all servicing, repair, or correction that may be necessary for your computer equipment and software as a result of any viruses, errors or any other problems whatsoever you may have as a result of visiting the Site. Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts, or the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, the above limitations may not apply to you.
Back to Top
Limitation of Liability
IN NO EVENT SHALL P&G BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, .PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL, DAMAGES, OR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, EVEN IF P&G HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, WHETHER IN AN ACTION UNDER CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, OR ANY OTHER THEORY, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE, INABILITY TO USE, OR PERFORMANCE OF THE INFORMATION, SERVICES, PRODUCTS, AND MATERIALS AVAILABLE FROM THIS SITE. THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY.
If the foregoing limitation of liability is held to be unenforceable, the Providers’ maximum liability to you shall not exceed the amount paid by you for the products or services you have ordered through the Site. Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability for certain damages, so the above limitations and exclusion may not apply to you to the extent such jurisdiction’s law is applicable to these Terms. If the law applies to you and your use of the Site does not permit the waiver by you of any rights or remedies, these Terms do not require you to waive any of such rights.
Back to Top
Indemnification
You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless P&G, its officers, directors, employees, agents, licensors and suppliers from and against all losses, expenses, damages and costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, resulting from any violation by you of the Terms, your use of the Site (including negligent or wrongful conduct) and/or the use of any Site for which you have registered by any other person using your user account.

Applicable Law and Disputes
To the extent permitted by law, the Terms shall be governed by and interpreted in all respects in accordance with the substantive laws of the State of Ohio, U.S.A., without regard to its choice of law provisions, and not by the 1980 U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.
YOU AGREE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS YOU ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AND THAT YOU MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST P&G (INCLUDING ANY P&G BRAND) ONLY IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. ANY LITIGATION OR OTHER ACTION OR PROCEEDING WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED.
There might be an occasion in which you and P&G (including any P&G Brand) are subject to a Dispute (as defined below) that directly or indirectly arises out of, or relates, to these Terms, a P&G Website, or your purchase or use of a product, good, or service from P&G (including from a P&G Brand). In the event of such a Dispute, you agree (i) to comply with the Mandatory Informal Dispute Resolution Process as set forth below, and, (ii) that, if the Mandatory Informal Dispute Resolution Process does not resolve the Dispute, then you will comply with the Formal Dispute Resolution Process.
Mandatory Informal Dispute Resolution Process
For any Dispute that arises between you and P&G (including between you and any P&G Brand) concerning or otherwise related to these Terms, a P&G Website, or your purchase or use of a product, good, or service from P&G (including from a P&G Brand), you agree that you will first make a good faith effort to resolve such a Dispute informally before initiating any formal dispute resolution proceeding, as set forth below.
This informal dispute resolution process is a condition precedent and prerequisite to commencing legal action against P&G (including any P&G brand). This informal dispute resolution process requires that you send a written description of the Dispute, including the nature and basis of the claim and the nature and basis of the specific relief sought (with a calculation for it), to the other party that also includes contact information (name, address, email, phone number, and, if applicable, account number, purchase order numbers, and transaction confirmation codes) (the “Notice”). For any Dispute you initiate, you agree to send this Notice, along with this contact information and other data sufficient for us to identify your transaction, account, or other relevant information with us at the following: The Procter & Gamble Company, C T Corporation System 4400 Easton Commons Way Suite 125 Columbus, Ohio 43219. You must personally sign the Notice (along with an attorney if you are represented) that is mailed to us.
After the Notice of your intent to engage in the informal dispute resolution process is transmitted and received by us, in accordance with the aforementioned instructions, each party hereby agrees to promptly negotiate in good faith about the Dispute. This process should lead to resolution of the Dispute, but if the Dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) days after receipt of the fully completed Notice of the informal dispute, each party agrees to the Formal Dispute Resolution Process set forth below. The parties agree that any relevant limitations period and filing fee or other deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in this informal dispute resolution process. A court shall have the authority to enforce the terms of this mandatory informal dispute resolution process.
Formal Dispute Resolution Process
Any Dispute between you and P&G (including between you and any P&G Brand) directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to these Terms, a P&G Website, or your purchase or use of a product, good, or service from P&G (including from a P&G Brand) that cannot be resolved through the aforementioned informal dispute resolution process shall be resolved exclusively in the state or federal courts located in Hamilton County, Ohio. You hereby irrevocably consent to such venue and to the exclusive jurisdiction of any such court over any such dispute. YOU FURTHER IRREVOCABLY WAIVE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT YOU MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND P&G (INCLUDING BETWEEN YOU AND ANY P&G BRAND) CONCERNING OR OTHERWISE RELATED TO THESE TERMS, A P&G WEBSITE, OR YOUR PURCHASE OR USE OF A PRODUCT, GOOD, OR SERVICE FROM P&G (INCLUDING A P&G BRAND).
Miscellaneous
Any cause of action or claim you may have directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to the Terms, a P&G Website, or your purchase or use of a product, good, or service from P&G must be commenced within one (1) year after the claim or cause of action arises.
The Privacy Statement provides separate options for individuals to lodge complaints in relation to the Privacy Statement and their personal information.
These dispute resolution processes do not limit your obligations to comply with any other provisions or requirements in these Terms, including the “Notices And Procedures For Making Claims Of Copyright Infringement”.
Terms
For purposes of these Terms, the term “Dispute” shall be interpreted as broadly as permitted under the law and shall cover any claim or controversy, related to P&G or our relationship with you, including but not limited to, any and all: (i) claims for relief and theories of liability, whether based in contract, tort, fraud, misrepresentation, negligence, statute, regulation, ordinance, or otherwise; (ii) claims that arose before these Terms; (iii) claims that arise after the termination of these Terms; and (iv) claims that are the subject of purported class action litigation.
Back to Top
No Waiver
No failure on the part of P&G to enforce any part of the Terms shall constitute a waiver of any of P&G’s rights under the Terms whether for part or future actions on the part of any person. Neither the receipt of any funds by P&G nor the reliance of any person on P&G’s actions shall be deemed to constitute a waiver of any part of the Terms. Only a specific, written waiver signed by an authorized representative of P&G shall have any legal effect whatsoever.

P&G’s Consumer Health Data Privacy Policy
Effective March 1, 2024
The Procter & Gamble Company (“P&G”, “P&G Co”, “We”) is committed to respecting your privacy. Our Global Privacy Policy describes how we handle your personal data generally. This supplemental Consumer Health Data Privacy Policy (“Health Privacy Policy”) explains our practices for “Consumer Health Data” as such term is defined by applicable laws including Washington’s My Health My Data Act, Nevada’s Consumer Health Data Privacy Law, Connecticut’s Data Privacy Act, and other U.S. health privacy laws, as each are amended and as and when they become effective including any regulations thereunder (“U.S. Health Privacy Laws”).
“Consumer Health Data” is broadly defined to mean personal information that is linked or can be reasonably linked to a consumer and that that identifies past, present or future physical or mental health status. Consumer Health Data includes information about medical conditions as well as non-medical information, such as biometric data, information about use of non-prescription medication or use of health-related products, for example. Consumer Health Data does not include information pertaining to individuals with whom we have an employment relationship.
If we make any material updates to this Health Privacy Policy, we will notify you as required by U.S. Health Privacy Laws, including by either notifying you at the time of collecting Consumer Health Data, or by updating this Health Privacy Policy earlier than required. We reserve the right to amend this Health Privacy Policy at our discretion and at any time. 
Categories of Consumer Health Data that We Collect
P&G only collects, uses and discloses Consumer Health Data as needed to provide you with the products or services that you request or with your consent.
P&G may collect Consumer Health Data related to the following categories of Consumer Health Data:
Product Interests. Information about your interest in certain health-related brands or products, such as when you visit some of our websites and mobile applications or buy certain products.

Biometric Data. Information generated by measurements of your biological characteristics or other unique biological patterns, such as measurements of photos or videos of your face, skin, or teeth for product recommendations or product research studies. 
Genetic Information. Information that concerns your genetic characteristics.  We normally process this in the context of research studies rather than marketing programs.

From you, such as when you request certain health-related products and services, join certain brand marketing email lists or loyalty programs, or volunteer the information in connection with surveys or promotions.
From your interactions with us, such as when you use our health-related apps or browse our websites for brands related to health.
From our business and marketing partners, who provide us with information about consumers who are viewing our content across websites or apps, purchasing our products, or taking advantage of our promotions.
From other third-party sources such as data brokers who provide us with information about consumers that may be interested in our products.
We may also infer or derive Consumer Health Data by analyzing other non-health related data we have about you or other consumers.
Disclosures of Consumer Health Data
We do not sell your Consumer Health Data. We also do not share your Consumer Health Data with any Third Parties or Affiliates.

Your Privacy Rights
You have specific rights with respect to your Consumer Health Data:
You have the right to know if we are collecting, using or disclosing your Consumer Health Data, to access that consumer health data, including receiving a list of the entities and affiliates with whom we have shared or sold your information, though currently we do not sell or share your Consumer Health Data with Third Parties or Affiliates.
You have the right to request that we delete your Consumer Health Data.
If we are processing your Consumer Health Data with your consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent. For cookie-related Consumer Health Data, you can do this by visiting your “Cookie Preferences” in the bottom right corner of our health-related websites or in the Settings menu of our mobile applications. Withdrawing your consent for collection of non-cookie related Consumer Health Data will effectuate a deletion request.
We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your rights. However, if you withdraw consent for collection and/or request deletion of your Consumer Health Data, we may remove you from certain marketing programs that rely on your Consumer Health Data to provide you the services.
To exercise these rights, please visit our Consumer Health Data Preference Center.  We will authenticate your requests and process it as required by law. Please allow up to 45 days for a response. If we deny your request, you may appeal that denial by clicking here. If your appeal is unsuccessful, you can file a complaint with the relevant government body in your state, including:
Washington State Attorney General at www.atg.wa.gov/file-complaint.
Nevada State Attorney General at https://ag.nv.gov/Complaints/File_Complaint/.

NOURISH YOUR HAIR & SCALP BACK TO HEALTH
Hair health is the foundation of beautiful hair but excessive styling, use of heat tools, and low-quality products can weaken or even break hair.  Increasing the use of conditioners and one-and-done treatments is not enough to restore the hair.

Endorsements, Reviews and Ratings
The below governs your conduct and obligations, and P&G's rights regarding Endorsements, Reviews and/or Ratings (hereafter “R&R”) of P&G product(s) and services (herein together referred to as “P&G products”) that you may submit on the P&G Sites.
Your Conduct & Obligations
When submitting a R&R you acknowledge and agree that:
your R&R is created and submitted by yourself, and made in good faith;
you are a genuine user of the P&G product at the time of your R&R which reflects your true and honest opinion;
you are at least 18 years old;
you, not P&G, are responsible for the contents of your R&R;

you will not include in the R&R any information that could identify you or others (you may submit the R&R with your first name or a nick name, but you may not include any other personal data in the R&R);
Notwithstanding the above, we may require specific personal data for authentication purposes (e.g., your e-mail address), and to communicate with you regarding your R&R, however this authentication personal information will not be published with the R&R.
You further acknowledge and agree that:
you are not an employee of P&G nor do you work for an affiliate or agency of P&G hired by P&G to promote and/or sell P&G products; OR, if that is the case, you .include a clear and conspicuous disclosure of your relationship with P&G in your R&R;

Notwithstanding the above, there may be specific P&G promotional activities that involve R&R with additional terms applying.
You further acknowledge and agree that:
your R&R does not contain content that is false, misleading, offensive, obscene, hate speech, derogatory, defamatory, libelous, slanderous, or otherwise inappropriate; that infringes any third party’s right (such as, but not limited to, copyright, trademark rights);
your R&R does not include any content about other companies or their brands;
your R&R does not contain programming or materials containing any Trojan horses, viruses, worms, harmful code, or other potentially damaging information, programs, or file; OR any other content that otherwise violates any other law or regulation.
P&G’s rights
P&G does not guarantee that you will have any opportunity to edit or delete your R&R. Except for any personal data we may collect from you as part of the authentication process and as part of our personal data processes that you consent to or that are mandated by law, any R&R will be considered non-confidential and non-proprietary.
By submitting a R&R and agreeing to these Terms when you make your submission, you grant P&G, to the extent allowed under applicable law, a non-exclusive, worldwide, unlimited, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, fully sublicensable and transferable right and license to use, monitor, review, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish (including to third-party websites as so-called “syndicated” R&R), translate, create derivative works from, distribute, transmit, display, and perform your R&R in whole or in part, in any media, format or technology, online or offline, without any further notice or payment to or permission needed from you.
Any opinions expressed in the R&R are of the individual submitting this, and not of P&G. We neither endorse nor guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness or any such R&R.
Notwithstanding the above, P&G uses trusted third parties that monitor R&R before publication for purposes of authentication and compliance (including to prevent, detect and monitor fraudulent R&R) . Random monitoring checks are also executed from time to time for sampling purposes to verify compliance with these terms.

P&G reserves the right to
- refuse or remove R&R and/or withdraw access to a User if the R&R violates these Terms and/or applicable laws and regulations;

Third-Party Links
The Sites may contain links to other sites on the Internet that are owned and operated by third parties (the ""External Sites""). Even if the third party is affiliated with P&G, P&G has no control over these External Sites, all of which have separate privacy policies, data collection practices and terms and conditions independent of P&G. P&G has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies or actions and is not responsible for the privacy practices, the terms and conditions or the content of such web sites. These linked sites are only for your convenience and therefore you access them at your own risk. Links do not imply that P&G sponsors, endorses, is affiliated with or associated with, or has been legally authorized to use any trademark, trade name, service mark, design, logo, symbol or other copyrighted materials displayed on or accessible through such External Sites.
If you determine to share any information about any P&G products through a social network platform, including through links provided by P&G through the Site, you may be able to post such information directly to your profile at the social networking platform without leaving the Site. Some social networking platforms enable functionality that allows a user to receive and transmit data to the social networking platform through use of overlays or other technology. Although it may appear that the data is collected by P&G, the data is in fact collected directly by the social networking platform and/or a third-party service provider. Your use of a social network platform to share any information is subject to, and you must comply with, the terms, conditions and restrictions of that social network platform and/or of the third-party service provider.

Geographic Scope of Site and Product Claims
P&G controls and operates the Sites all round the world. Each claim or statement about the effectiveness of P&G products and/or each claim or statement comparing the effectiveness of P&G products to the effectiveness of other products is expressly limited to the Country where the Site making these claims or statements is published, unless otherwise disclosed on the Site. Unless otherwise specified in or by the Sites, the Sites are intended to promote only those P&G products that are sold by P&G in the Country where the Site is published, and P&G makes no representation that materials in its Sites or the products described thereby are appropriate or available for use in other locations.
Access to the Sites from territories where their content is illegal is prohibited. Those who choose to access the Sites from locations outside the Country where the Site is published do so on their own initiative and risk and are responsible for compliance with applicable local laws. You may not use or export the Content in violation of export laws and regulations of the Country where the Site is published.

Contents of the Site – Disclaimer
All Content of the Site and any materials made available through the Site are provided ""as is"" and without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. To the fullest extent permissible pursuant to applicable law, P&G disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to, all implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and non-infringement. P&G does not warrant or make any representations regarding the use or the results of the use of the materials in the Site in terms of its correctness, accuracy, reliability, or otherwise. The materials in the Site could include technical inaccuracies or typographical errors. These materials could be inaccurate or become inaccurate as a result of development occurring after their respective dates. P&G undertakes no obligation to verify or maintain the accuracy of such information. Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts, or the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, the above limitations may not apply to you.
Back to Top
Operation of the Site – Disclaimer
P&G endeavors to maintain the Site and its operation, but is not, and cannot be, responsible for the results of any defects that may exist in the Site or its operation. As to the operation of the Site, P&G expressly disclaims all warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to all implied warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, title and non-infringement. P&G makes no warranty that (i) the operation of the Site will meet the user’s requirements; (ii) access to the Site will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, free of viruses, worms, Trojan Horses or other harmful components, or free of defects or errors; (iii) the results that may be obtained from the use of the Site will be accurate or reliable; or (iv) defects will be corrected. You (and not P&G) assume the entire cost of all servicing, repair, or correction that may be necessary for your computer equipment and software as a result of any viruses, errors or any other problems whatsoever you may have as a result of visiting the Site. Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts, or the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, the above limitations may not apply to you.
Back to Top
Limitation of Liability
IN NO EVENT SHALL P&G BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, .PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL, DAMAGES, OR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, EVEN IF P&G HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, WHETHER IN AN ACTION UNDER CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, OR ANY OTHER THEORY, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE, INABILITY TO USE, OR PERFORMANCE OF THE INFORMATION, SERVICES, PRODUCTS, AND MATERIALS AVAILABLE FROM THIS SITE. THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY.
If the foregoing limitation of liability is held to be unenforceable, the Providers’ maximum liability to you shall not exceed the amount paid by you for the products or services you have ordered through the Site. Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability for certain damages, so the above limitations and exclusion may not apply to you to the extent such jurisdiction’s law is applicable to these Terms. If the law applies to you and your use of the Site does not permit the waiver by you of any rights or remedies, these Terms do not require you to waive any of such rights.
Back to Top
Indemnification
You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless P&G, its officers, directors, employees, agents, licensors and suppliers from and against all losses, expenses, damages and costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, resulting from any violation by you of the Terms, your use of the Site (including negligent or wrongful conduct) and/or the use of any Site for which you have registered by any other person using your user account.

Applicable Law and Disputes
To the extent permitted by law, the Terms shall be governed by and interpreted in all respects in accordance with the substantive laws of the State of Ohio, U.S.A., without regard to its choice of law provisions, and not by the 1980 U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.
YOU AGREE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS YOU ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AND THAT YOU MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST P&G (INCLUDING ANY P&G BRAND) ONLY IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. ANY LITIGATION OR OTHER ACTION OR PROCEEDING WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED.
There might be an occasion in which you and P&G (including any P&G Brand) are subject to a Dispute (as defined below) that directly or indirectly arises out of, or relates, to these Terms, a P&G Website, or your purchase or use of a product, good, or service from P&G (including from a P&G Brand). In the event of such a Dispute, you agree (i) to comply with the Mandatory Informal Dispute Resolution Process as set forth below, and, (ii) that, if the Mandatory Informal Dispute Resolution Process does not resolve the Dispute, then you will comply with the Formal Dispute Resolution Process.
Mandatory Informal Dispute Resolution Process
For any Dispute that arises between you and P&G (including between you and any P&G Brand) concerning or otherwise related to these Terms, a P&G Website, or your purchase or use of a product, good, or service from P&G (including from a P&G Brand), you agree that you will first make a good faith effort to resolve such a Dispute informally before initiating any formal dispute resolution proceeding, as set forth below.
This informal dispute resolution process is a condition precedent and prerequisite to commencing legal action against P&G (including any P&G brand). This informal dispute resolution process requires that you send a written description of the Dispute, including the nature and basis of the claim and the nature and basis of the specific relief sought (with a calculation for it), to the other party that also includes contact information (name, address, email, phone number, and, if applicable, account number, purchase order numbers, and transaction confirmation codes) (the “Notice”). For any Dispute you initiate, you agree to send this Notice, along with this contact information and other data sufficient for us to identify your transaction, account, or other relevant information with us at the following: The Procter & Gamble Company, C T Corporation System 4400 Easton Commons Way Suite 125 Columbus, Ohio 43219. You must personally sign the Notice (along with an attorney if you are represented) that is mailed to us.
After the Notice of your intent to engage in the informal dispute resolution process is transmitted and received by us, in accordance with the aforementioned instructions, each party hereby agrees to promptly negotiate in good faith about the Dispute. This process should lead to resolution of the Dispute, but if the Dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) days after receipt of the fully completed Notice of the informal dispute, each party agrees to the Formal Dispute Resolution Process set forth below. The parties agree that any relevant limitations period and filing fee or other deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in this informal dispute resolution process. A court shall have the authority to enforce the terms of this mandatory informal dispute resolution process.
Formal Dispute Resolution Process
Any Dispute between you and P&G (including between you and any P&G Brand) directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to these Terms, a P&G Website, or your purchase or use of a product, good, or service from P&G (including from a P&G Brand) that cannot be resolved through the aforementioned informal dispute resolution process shall be resolved exclusively in the state or federal courts located in Hamilton County, Ohio. You hereby irrevocably consent to such venue and to the exclusive jurisdiction of any such court over any such dispute. YOU FURTHER IRREVOCABLY WAIVE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT YOU MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND P&G (INCLUDING BETWEEN YOU AND ANY P&G BRAND) CONCERNING OR OTHERWISE RELATED TO THESE TERMS, A P&G WEBSITE, OR YOUR PURCHASE OR USE OF A PRODUCT, GOOD, OR SERVICE FROM P&G (INCLUDING A P&G BRAND).
Miscellaneous
Any cause of action or claim you may have directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to the Terms, a P&G Website, or your purchase or use of a product, good, or service from P&G must be commenced within one (1) year after the claim or cause of action arises.
The Privacy Statement provides separate options for individuals to lodge complaints in relation to the Privacy Statement and their personal information.
These dispute resolution processes do not limit your obligations to comply with any other provisions or requirements in these Terms, including the “Notices And Procedures For Making Claims Of Copyright Infringement”.
Terms
For purposes of these Terms, the term “Dispute” shall be interpreted as broadly as permitted under the law and shall cover any claim or controversy, related to P&G or our relationship with you, including but not limited to, any and all: (i) claims for relief and theories of liability, whether based in contract, tort, fraud, misrepresentation, negligence, statute, regulation, ordinance, or otherwise; (ii) claims that arose before these Terms; (iii) claims that arise after the termination of these Terms; and (iv) claims that are the subject of purported class action litigation.
Back to Top
No Waiver
No failure on the part of P&G to enforce any part of the Terms shall constitute a waiver of any of P&G’s rights under the Terms whether for part or future actions on the part of any person. Neither the receipt of any funds by P&G nor the reliance of any person on P&G’s actions shall be deemed to constitute a waiver of any part of the Terms. Only a specific, written waiver signed by an authorized representative of P&G shall have any legal effect whatsoever.

  Last Updated: December 1, 2023
  This Mobile Application End User Agreement (“Agreement”) is a binding agreement between you (“Licensee”) and Mielle Organics, LLC, 8707 Louisiana St. Merrillville, IN 46410 (“Licensor”). This Agreement governs Licensee’s use of Licensor’s mobile application (“Application”), which includes (i) all related software components, (ii) any printed materials and/or online or electronic help files and operating manuals about the Application (“Documentation”), and (iii) any information or databases that may be accessible via the Application.
  BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, OR USING THE APPLICATION, LICENSEE HEREBY REPRESENTS THAT LICENSEE IS AT LEAST EIGHTEEN (18) YEARS OF AGE OR OF LEGAL AGE TO ENTER INTO A BINDING AGREEMENT AND HAS READ, UNDERSTANDS, AND ACCEPTS, AND IS LEGALLY BOUND BY, THIS Agreement. IF LICENSEE DOES NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS Agreement, LICENSEE MUST NOT DOWNLOAD, INSTALL, OR USE THE APPLICATION AND MUST DELETE IT FROM LICENSEE’S MOBILE DEVICE.
  1          License Rights and Restrictions
  1.1        License Grant. Subject to Licensee’s compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Licensor hereby grants to Licensee a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable and non-sublicensable right to (i) download, install, and use the Application for Licensee’s personal, non-commercial use on a mobile device owned, leased, or otherwise controlled by Licensee (“Mobile Device”) strictly in accordance with the Documentation, and (ii) access, stream, download, and use on such Mobile Device the Content and Services (as defined in Section 1.4 of this Agreement) made available in or otherwise accessible through the Application, strictly in accordance with this Agreement. The foregoing constitutes a license, not a sale, of the Application. All rights not expressly granted to Licensee herein are reserved to Licensor, and Licensee does not acquire any ownership interest in the Application under this Agreement, or any other rights thereto other than to use the Application in accordance with the license granted, and subject to all terms, conditions, and restrictions, under this Agreement. Licensee hereby acknowledges and agrees that Licensee is solely responsible and liable for any use of the Application that occurs on the Mobile Device, including whether such use is by Licensee or by any third party (“Third Party User”) whatsoever, regardless of whether Licensee grants such Third Party User authorization or permission to use the Application. For the avoidance of doubt, this Agreement applies to each Mobile Device that downloads, installs, or uses the Application and regardless of whether the Application is downloaded, installed, or used on multiple Mobile Devices.
  1.2        License Restrictions. Unless otherwise provided for in this Agreement, Licensee shall not, and shall ensure that any Third Party User does not, undertake, facilitate, or otherwise engage in any of the following: (i) copy the Application, in whole or in part, (ii) modify, correct, adapt, translate, enhance, or otherwise prepare derivative works or improvements of any Application, (iii) rent, lease, lend, sell, sublicense, assign, distribute, publish, transfer, or otherwise make available the Application to any third party, (iv) reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, decode, or adapt the Application, or attempt to derive or gain access to the source code of the Application, in whole or in part, (v) bypass or breach any security device or protection used for or contained in the Application, (vi) remove, delete, efface, alter, obscure, translate, combine, supplement, or otherwise change any trademarks, terms of any Documentation, warranties, disclaimers, or copyright notice or other proprietary rights notices or other symbols, notices, marks, or serial numbers on or relating to any copy of the Application, (vii) use the Application in any manner or for any purpose that infringes, misappropriates, or otherwise violates any right or privilege (including an intellectual property right or privacy right) of any person, or that violates any applicable law, statute, or regulation, or any judicial or administrative order, rule, or judgment, (viii) use the Application for purposes of benchmarking or competitive analysis of the Application, developing, using, or providing a competing Application product or service; or, any other purpose that is to Licensor’s detriment or commercial disadvantage, (ix) use the Application on any device or equipment not permitted by the Documentation, or (x) access or use the Application in any manner that is inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement.
  1.3        Third Party Application; Open Source Licenses. The Application may include Application components that are provided by a third party (“Third Party Application”) or that are subject to an open source license agreement, including components available under the GNU Affero General Public License, GNU General Public License, GNU Lesser General Public License, Mozilla Public License, Apache License, BSD licenses, or any other license that is approved by the Open Source Initiative (each individually, or collectively, referred to as “Open Source Components”). Any use of Third Party Application or Open Source Components by Licensee shall be solely governed by the terms and conditions of the applicable Third Party Application license or open source license(s) and not by the terms of this Agreement. When appropriate, the applicable licenses shall be set forth in the “readme” or “about” files of the Application or otherwise made available by Licensor.
  1.4        Content and Services. The Application may provide Licensee with access to Licensor’s website located at https://mielleorganics.com/ (the “Licensor Website”) and products and services accessible thereon, and certain features, functionality, and content accessible on or through the Application may be hosted on the Licensor Website (collectively, “Content and Services”). Licensee’s access to and use of such Content and Services are governed by any additional Terms of Use and Privacy Policy located on the Licensor Website, which are incorporated herein and form an integral part of this Agreement. Any violation of these Terms of Use and Privacy Policy will also be deemed a violation of this Agreement. The Content and Services are based in the state of Ohio in the United States and provided for access and use only by persons located in the United States. Licensee acknowledge that Licensee may not be able to access all or some of the Content and Services outside of the United States and that access thereto may not be legal by certain persons or in certain countries. If Licensee accesses the Content and Services from outside the United States, Licensee is responsible for compliance with local laws.
  2          Term and Termination
  2.1        Term. The term of this Agreement commences the earlier of when Licensee (i) downloads or installs the Application or (ii) otherwise acknowledges acceptance of this Agreement, and the term of this Agreement will continue in effect until terminated by Licensee or Licensor. Licensee may terminate this Agreement at any time by notifying Licensor in writing of the same and by deleting the Application and all copies thereof from the Mobile Device. Licensor may terminate this Agreement at any time and with or without notice to Licensee. In addition, this Agreement will terminate immediately and automatically without any notice to Licensee if Licensee violates any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

Licensee agrees that, in addition to the rights afforded to Licensor under this Agreement, Licensor may use, compile, and monitor statistical information based on information gathered or transmitted to Licensor via the Application, including to verify the proper use of the Application, to improve the Application generally, for the creation of new products and services, and for other business purposes. Licensee represents to Licensor that Licensee has the full authority to provide any such Feedback to Licensor. 
7          Intellectual Property. Licensor owns and retains all rights, interests, and licenses to the Application, and Licensee does not acquire any ownership interest in the Application or the Documentation whatsoever. Licensee shall, during the term and at its own cost and expense (i) undertake all commercially reasonable measures to safeguard the Application (including all copies thereof) from infringement, misappropriation, theft, misuse, or unauthorized access, (ii) take all such steps as Licensor may reasonably require to assist Licensor in maintaining the validity, enforceability, and Licensor’s ownership, of the intellectual property rights in the Application, (iii) promptly notify Licensor in writing if Licensee becomes aware of any actual or suspected infringement, misappropriation or other violation of Licensor’s intellectual property rights in or relating to the Application, (iv) promptly notify Licensor in writing if Licensee becomes aware of any claim that the Application, including any production, use, marketing, sale or other disposition of the Application, in whole or in part, infringes, misappropriates or otherwise violates the intellectual property rights or other rights of any third party, and (v) at Licensor’s sole expense, fully cooperate with and assist Licensor in all reasonable ways in the conduct of any legal action by Licensor to prevent or abate any actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of Licensor’s rights in, and to attempt to resolve any legal actions relating to, the Application.
8          Disclaimers and Liability. Licensee ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THE APPLICATION IS PROVIDED “AS IS,” “AS AVAILABLE,” AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, WHICH WARRANTIES ARE HEREBY DISCLAIMED. Licensee ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THE APPLICATION MAY NOT MEET LICENSEE’S REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE OPERATION OF THE APPLICATION AND/OR USE OF APPLICATIOn MAY BE INTERRUPTED, THAT ANY ERRORS MAY REMAIN UNCORRECTED, AND THAT THE APPLICATION MAY NOT BE COMPATIBLE WITH CERTAIN INFORMATION SYSTEMS. Licensor IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY SOFTWARE INSTALLED OR USED BY LICENSEE OR THIRD PARTY USERS OR FOR THE OPERATION OR PERFORMANCE OF THE INTERNET. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, TRANSMISSION OF MALICIOUS PROGRAMS OR CODE, LOSS OF DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR ANY OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO Licensee’s USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE APPLICATION (INCLUDING ANY SUPPORT SERVICES), REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) AND EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT SHALL LICENSOR’S TOTAL LIABILITY TO LICENSEE FOR ANY AND ALL DAMAGES EXCEED THE LESSER OF (I) THE AMOUNT OF THE License FEES PAID FOR THE APPLICATION OR (II) one hundred dollars ($100.00). THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY EVEN IF A REMEDY STATED HEREIN FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. ANY AND ALL CAUSES OF ACTION OR CLAIMS LICENSEE MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR TO THE APPLICATION MUST BE COMMENCED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES; OTHERWISE SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM IS PERMANENTLY BARRED. 
9          Indemnification. Licensee shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Licensor and its affiliates, employees, agents, officers, directors, shareholders, representatives, successors and assigns from and against any loss, liability, cause of action, cost or expense (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from, in connection with or related to: (i) any breach of this Agreement by Licensee, any employee or agent of Licensee, or any Third Party User, (ii) the acts and omissions of Licensee and its employees and agents, and any Third Party User, in connection with its/their use of the Application, and (iii) the violation, infringement or misappropriation by Licensee or any employee or agent of Licensee, of the intellectual property rights of Licensor.

Restored the health of my daughter's hair. It's in excellent condition once again thanks to Mielle's Rosemary mint and rice water haircare products. I refuse to use anything else! Therefore, it's been a blessing to find something that works and allows her to maintain a beautiful and healthy mane of hair. Thanks Mielle!!

Please be aware that, even if you opt-out of certain kinds of interest-based ads, you may continue to receive other ads. Further, opting out of one or more NAI or DAA members only means that those selected members should no longer under the DAA / NAI rules deliver certain targeted ads to you. This will affect services provided by the applicable DAA / NAI members but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads from non-participating parties. Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit the opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different Device or web browser(s), or use a non-browser-based method of access, your DAA / NAI browser-based opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective. Mobile device opt-outs will not affect browser-based Interest-based ads even on the same device, and you must opt-out separately for each device. We are not responsible for the effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third party opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.
You can also prevent or reduce getting interest-based ads on websites by declining cookies in your browser(s), or on mobile devices by declining the “access to data” requests that apps usually present when you install them or by adjusting the ad tracking settings on your device.
Please note that you may also receive personalized ads based on your email address or phone number, if you have provided those to us for marketing purposes. To opt out of that usage, please contact us here (Note: Please ensure you select the correct location / country of your residence by clicking the button in the top left corner).
You will still see “contextual” ads even if you opt out of interest-based ads. Even if we stop sending you interest-based ads, you will still get ads from our brands on your computer or mobile devices. These ads, however, are based on the context of the sites you visit and are called contextual ads. Unlike interest-based ads which are based on pages you visit on your mobile phone or computer viewing activities over time and across unrelated services, contextual ads are ads shown to you based on the context of the specific site you are visiting. For example, you still may see an ad for one of our baby care brands while looking at nursery products online because these sites traditionally have had mostly new or expecting parents as visitors. You should also know that we may still collect information from your computer or devices and use it for other purposes like evaluating how our websites work, for consumer research, or detecting fraud, pursuant to applicable laws.
How You Can Control Cookies
You can set your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent to your computer. However, this may prevent our sites or services from working properly. You can also set your browser to delete cookies every time you finish browsing.
When you opt-out of interest-based advertising, an opt-out cookie is sent to your browser that indicates that you no longer want to receive interest-based ads. Your opt-out cookie will be deleted if you decide to delete all cookies on your browser. This means that you will need to opt-out again on each browser where you have deleted cookies if you still do not want to receive interest-based ads.
In some markets and on some of our websites, we offer a cookie consent management platform which allows you to exercise choice with respect to certain categories of cookies. If this is available, this may appear as a cookie banner and/or as an icon that is visible on the applicable websites. We may also provide similar technology in mobile apps, which, if available, will be accessible through the applicable app’s settings menu.

How We Gather & Use Personal Data
Like most brands, we collect personal data as you interact with us or when you share personal data with third parties that in turn can be shared with us. We do this respectfully and carefully to protect your rights. Personal data can help us better understand your interests and preferences as a consumer and a person.
How We Collect Personal Data
We collect personal data about you in many ways and from many places. Some of the personal data we collect may include personal data that can be used to identify you; for example, your name, email address, telephone number, or postal address. In some jurisdictions, things like IP address or cookie and mobile device identifiers may also be considered personal data. Some of the personal data we collect may be considered sensitive personal data or special category data and may include, account login information, financial information, precise geolocation data, government identifiers, racial or ethnic origin, mental & physical health / condition, Consumer Health Data, sex life or sexual orientation, transgender / non binary status, children’s data, criminal background, genetic data and biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying an individual etc.
You Share it Directly
You give us your personal data directly for example when signing up for an account on our websites or mobile apps or by calling or emailing us, or while participating in a P&G survey or contest etc. We may ask for things like your name, email or home address, date of birth, payment information, your age, gender, the number of people in your family, and the way you want us to send you information about our products and services—for example, to your home address, email address, or by texting you.
You Interact with Websites & Emails
We may use technologies that automatically collect information when you visit our sites, view our advertisements, or use our products or services. For example, we use cookies (a tiny file stored on your computer’s browser) to tell us what browser and operating system you are using, your IP address, and about your online activities such as web pages you visit, links you click, or whether you have or have not opened an email from us.
You Use Mobile Apps & Other Devices
To give you the best possible user experience, we may use technologies that collect information from your phone when you use our mobile apps or our “smart” devices in your home. You consent to this when downloading the app or installing household internet connected devices. This information could include your mobile phone or other device advertising ID, information about your phone’s operating system, how you use the app or device, your physical location, and other information that is considered personal data in some jurisdictions. You will get a pop-up notice on your phone or device that gives you the option to accept or reject allowing us to know your precise geolocation (exactly where you are standing or where you are accessing the internet) or to collect or access other personal data, as required by the applicable laws.
You Connect with Partners or Third Parties
We may get information that other companies share with or sell to us. For example, you may have given consent for another company to share your personal data with us when you signed up for telecom services or a retailer loyalty points program. Where possible, we may also collect personal data from publicly available sources, such as from internet postings, blog entries, videos, or social media sites. We may also receive personal data from other companies, such as consumer data resellers, who are in the business of collecting or aggregating information about you sourced from publicly available databases (in line with local legal requirements as applicable) or from consent you have given to their use and subsequently our use of your personal data. This might include information about your income level, age, gender, number of people in your family, and products you have bought on the internet or from stores in your neighborhood.

How We Use Cookies
Cookies are small files sent to your computer as you surf the web. They store useful information about how you interact with the websites you visit. You can learn more about how to control cookies
here
.
We use cookies in several ways, such as:
to allow you to browse the website and use its features
to serve you with relevant advertising and measure the effectiveness of such advertising
to ensure that you are not shown an ad more than you should be (called “frequency capping”)
to learn more about the way you interact with P&G content
to help us improve your experience when visiting our websites
to remember your preferences, such as a language or a region, so there is no need for you to customize the website on each visit
to identify errors and resolve them
to analyze how well our websites are performing
Types of Cookies We Use
Strictly Necessary Cookies:  These cookies (also sometimes referred to as “essential”) allow the page to load or provide some essential functionality without which the page would not work (i.e., store your data in a shopping cart).
Functional Cookies:  These cookies allow sites to remember what you prefer when you come back again. For example, if you choose to read the site in French on your first visit, the next time you come back the site will appear automatically in French. Not having to select a language preference every time makes it more convenient, more efficient, and user-friendly for you.
Advertising / Targeting Cookies: These cookies can be used to learn about what interests you generally might have, based, for example, on the websites you visit and the products you buy. That data allows us to send you ads for products and services that better fit the things you like or need. It also allows us to limit the number of times you see the same advertisement.
Analytics / Performance Cookies: These cookies tell us how you use our websites, like which pages you visited and which links you clicked. This helps us measure and improve the performance of our websites. We use different analytics cookies in different jurisdictions. In many cases, we use Google Analytics cookies to monitor the performance of our sites. Our ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to our sites is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy.
Social Media Cookies: These cookies, that are set by a range of social media services that we have added to the site, allow you to share our content with your friends and networks and enable us to reach you with ads on those social platforms related to your visits on our sites. The cookies of some social media sites, e.g., Facebook, are also used for ad targeting.
Interest-Based Advertising
When you visit our partner sites, we can show you ads or other content we believe you would like to see. For example, you may receive advertisements for Tide® laundry detergent if we notice that you are visiting sites that sell children’s clothing or school supplies. And from that information we may conclude that you have children and therefore could well be interested in a powerful laundry-cleaning product. In this way, we intend to send you relevant information about our products that might be of benefit to you. To learn more about your choices regarding interest-based advertising go
here
.
We Learn from Groups of Consumers Sharing Similar Interests:  We may place you into a particular group of consumers who show the same interests. For example, we may put you in the group of “razor aficionados” if we see you frequently purchase razors online or you could be a “bargain-shopper” if we notice you use online coupons or look for discounts or sales. We may infer these things about you based on your activity on certain web pages, links you click on our websites and other websites you visit, mobile applications you use, or our brand emails you view and links you click in the emails, as well based on other information we have collected, such as from retailer partners and other third parties. We group together cookie and device IDs to help us learn about general trends, habits, or characteristics from a group of consumers who all act similarly online and/or offline. By doing this, we can find and serve many others who “look like” those already in the group and thereby send them what we believe will be relevant and beneficial product offers and information.
We Link Other Information to Your Cookie and Device IDs:  Your cookie and device IDs may be supplemented with other information, such as information about the products you buy offline or information that you provide directly to us when creating an account on our sites. We generally do this in ways that will not directly personally identify you. For example, we could know that cookie ID ABC12345 belongs to the razor aficionado group based on a person’s web site visits, age, gender, and shopping habits. Should we want to personally identify your cookie or device information (web and app viewing history), we will do so in accordance with applicable laws.
We May Know You Across Your Computers, Tablets, Phones and Devices:  We may know that cookie ID ABC12345 is from a computer that that may be connected to the same person or household owning the mobile phone with device ID EFG15647. This means that you may search for diapers on your laptop, click on a Google search result link which we have sponsored, and then later see an ad for our Pampers® brand diapers on your mobile phone. We might assume or deduce that the same person owns the computer and phone because, for example, they sign on to the same Wi-Fi network every day at the same time. Understanding what devices seem to be used by a person or household helps us limit the number of times you see the same ad across your devices. And this is important because that way you don’t get annoyed at us for spamming you with the same ad and we don’t pay for such repetitive ads that we don’t want you to receive.
Addressable Media: When you provide us with your personal data via our sites or apps, we may use an encryption of that data – or a substitute identifier such as The Trade Desk's UID2 -- to serve you with ads we think you may like. We do this generally by uploading a pseudonymized version (replaced with artificial letters or numbers) of your email address, phone number, or your mobile advertising ID to a platform that offers ad space (e.g., Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, etc.). We also use that same data to serve you advertising through what is called the open web. This means you may see relevant ads from us on sites like nytimes.com or apps or other places like digital TV that participate in online auctions of their ad inventory.
Advanced Matching: Some of our sites use the Advanced Matching features offered by Social Media Platforms to its advertisers (e.g. Facebook’s Advanced Matching, TikTok’s Advanced Matching, etc.). Through Advanced Matching, we may send some of the personal data you enter on our site form fields (e.g., your name, email address, and phone number – not any sensitive personal data or special category data) in a pseudonymized format to the Social Media Platform, or the Social Media Platform Pixel will pseudonymize and pull that data automatically, for the purpose of helping associate you with your browser cookie or device ID. We do this so that we can better target and measure the effectiveness of our advertising on the respective Social Media platforms. This is how we can know that if we showed you an ad on a given Social Media Platform, you clicked on it, came to our site and bought something – or not – and therefore whether we should continue to buy ads on that Social Media Platform – or not.
Google Analytics Advertising Features: Some of our sites use Google Remarketing Lists for Search Ads with Analytics (“RLSA”), which is a service they offer to advertisers. When individuals visit our sites, Google Analytics collects data about their visits (and not any sensitive personal data or special category data). If a visitor is signed into their Google account, we are able to provide that user with interest-based advertising when they conduct a Google search for terms related to the P&G site they visited. For example, if you are signed into a Google account when visiting our Head & Shoulders website, we may provide you with Head & Shoulders advertising when you search for “dandruff shampoo” on Google. Our ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to our sites is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy. To understand how Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps, visit here. You may opt out of Google Analytics at any time.
Other Technologies We May Use
Proximity-Based Beacons:  Beacons send one-way signals to mobile apps you install on your phone over very short distances to tell you, for example, what products are on-sale as you walk through a store. Beacons only talk to your device when you get close enough and after you have given consent within the mobile application associated with a particular beacon. In turn, apps may provide us location information to help customize advertising and offers to you. For example, when you are near a beacon in the skin care section of a supermarket, we may send you a $4 off coupon.
Pixels: These are small objects embedded into a web page but are not visible. They are also known as ""tags,” “web bugs,” or ""pixel gifs."" We may use pixels to deliver cookies to your computer, monitor our website activity, make logging into our sites easier, and for online marketing activities. We may also include pixels in our promotional email messages or newsletters to determine whether you open them and click on their links. This helps us understand whether you are an active user (which will prevent your data from being deleted due to inactivity). It also helps us measure the effectiveness of our marketing efforts, and derive insights and analysis, that we will use to personalize the content of our communication and to guide our marketing decisions (for example, if you opened an email but did not click on the links in it, we may decide to retarget you on Facebook).
Mobile Device Identifiers and SDKs:  We use software code in our mobile apps to collect information as you use our apps which is like what cookies collect on our websites. This will be information like your mobile phone identifiers (iOS IDFAs and Android Advertising IDs) and the way you use our apps.
Precise Geolocation:  We may receive information about your exact location from things like global positioning system (GPS) coordinates (longitude and latitude) when you use our mobile apps. You will always get a pop-up notice on your phone or device asking for you to accept or reject allowing us to know exactly where you are in the world. You should understand that we will not always ask for consent to know generally that you are in a broader city, postal code, or province. For example, we do not consider it to be precise location if all we know is that you are somewhere in Manila, Philippines.
Site and App Content
Plugins:  Our websites may include plugins from other companies such as social networks. An example of a plugin is the Facebook “Like” button. These plugins may collect information (e.g., the URL of the page you visited) and send it back to the company that created them. This may happen even if you do not click on the plugin. These plugins are governed by the privacy policy and terms of the company that created them, even though they appear on our sites.
Logins:  Our websites may allow you to log in using your account with another company such as, for example, “Login with Facebook.” When you do this, we will have access only to the information that you have given us consent to receive from your account settings in the other company’s account you’re using to log in with.
User Content:  Some of our sites and apps will allow you to upload your own content for contests, blogs, videos, and other functions. Please remember that any information you submit or post becomes public information. We do not have control over how others may use the content you submit to our sites and apps. We are not responsible for such uses in ways that may violate this privacy policy, the law, or your personal privacy and safety.
Links:  P&G sites may include links to other sites, which we do not control. Those sites will be governed by their own privacy policies and terms, not ours.
Automated Decision-Making and Profiling
Automated decision-making implies making a decision using automated means without human involvement. Profiling is a form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal characteristics of an individual for the purpose of analyzing or predicting, for example, that individual’s personal preferences, interests, likely behavior, etc.
As you have read in this Privacy Policy, we collect a variety of types of personal data both from you and from other commercially available sources. This data may be combined and analyzed, including sometimes using algorithms, to identify links between certain behaviors and personal characteristics. P&G users who have similar characteristics or have performed similar actions are likely to share similar interests in our products: based on this analysis, segments of P&G consumers are created and targeted accordingly with relevant offers via email, online advertising, and social media.
This process allows us to customize our communications to your declared or inferred interests. However, we will not conduct any automated decision-making processes, including profiling, that can produce legal effects or that can similarly significantly affect your rights and freedoms, as per Art. 22(1) and (4) of the GDPR and, should we want to engage in more intrusive profiling and tracking practices, we will always inform you and, where legally required, ask for your consent before doing so or provide you with the right to opt-out.
How We Disclose Personal Data
With Your Consent
When we have your consent, we may disclose your personal data to others, such as select partners so they can send you offers, promotions, or ads about products or services we believe you may be interested in. For example, people who receive P&G emails from our diaper brands such as Pampers® may also consent to hear about baby formulas from other companies.
Online Platforms and Ad Tech Companies
Our websites and applications may make available contact information, unique identifiers, inferred and derived information, online and technical information and geolocation data with online platforms and ad tech companies to help us serve you relevant advertisements and offers, subject to applicable legal requirements, which may include consent and/or opt-outs.  We do not sell your personal data to marketers outside of P&G in exchange for monetary compensation. Please see the U.S. State Privacy Notice section of the privacy policy below for additional information.
Vendors
We may disclose or otherwise make available your personal data to our vendors (including “service providers” and “processors” defined under applicable laws, which we collectively refer to as “service providers” or “vendors” herein) who help us run our business. This includes hosting our sites, processing payment information for the purchases made by you through our sites, delivering our emails and marketing communications to you, analyzing the data we collect, helping us with sales attribution (e.g., to see if we showed you an ad on a platform site and then you bought a product from us) and sending you the products and services you requested. We also disclose or otherwise make available your personal data with lawyers, auditors, consultants, information technology and security firms, and others who provide services to us. We disclose or otherwise make available only the personal data needed for these companies to complete the tasks we request or, where permitted by applicable law, use the personal data for certain internal purposes such as security or fraud detection. We instruct our service providers to appropriately process and protect your personal data.
Payments for Purchases
Payments for purchases made through some of our sites are completed using a third-party vendor’s online payment system.  For these sites, P&G does not have access to your credit card information provided for purchases and does not store or disclose your credit card information as part of your purchases through these third-party systems. The personal or financial information you provide to our online payment system on these sites is subject to the third-party’s privacy policy and terms of use and we recommend you review these policies before providing any personal or financial information.
Legal and Similar Reasons
If a brand or one of our businesses that controls your personal data, or some or all of its business assets, are sold to another company, your personal data will be disclosed to that company. We may also disclose your information to companies who help us protect our rights and property, or when required by law, legal processes, government authorities or as reasonably necessary to protect the rights or interests of ourselves or others.

We respect your personal data and take steps to protect it from loss, misuse, or alteration. Where appropriate, these steps can include technical measures like firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, unique and complex passwords, and encryption. We also use organizational and physical measures such as training staff on data processing obligations, identification of data incidents and risks, restricting staff access to your personal information, and ensuring physical security including appropriately securing documents when not being used.
International Transfers
P&G has its head offices in the United States, regional offices in Singapore, Dubai, Geneva and Panama and further P&G service centers in other countries, like Costa Rica or Philippines. As a multinational company, P&G undertakes data transfers, either within the P&G group of entities, or when sharing your data with service providers or selected partners that may store, process, or access your data in a country other than the one in which it was collected, including the United States. Personal data collected from Quebec, for example, may be transferred outside of Canada with adequate protections and safeguards in place.
As far as EU citizens are concerned, (but also citizens of Switzerland, UK and Serbia for example) this means that their data may be processed outside of the European Economic Area (EEA), either in countries that have been recognized by the European Commission to offer adequate data protection, like the United Kingdom (from where, for example, some of our fulfillment, return and contact center services are managed for the EU region), or Switzerland (where our EU headquarters are located), or in other countries that are not deemed, by the European Commission, as offering such level of data protection. For such transfers of data, because special safeguards need to be foreseen to ensure that the protection travels with the data, we use the EU Standard Contractual Clauses, standardized and pre-approved model data protection clauses. You can find the latest version of the approved EU Standard Contractual Clauses, including the different transfer modules, here. Our transfer agreements also incorporate the standard data protection clauses issued in accordance with UK, Swiss and Serbian data protection law If you have any questions with reference to our data transfer agreements, please contact us.
If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) or Switzerland, please note that P&G is certified under the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) [collectively, the “Data Privacy Framework”] developed by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Commission and Information Commissioner and Swiss Federal Data Protection, respectively, regarding the transfer of personal information from the EEA, United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) or Switzerland to the U.S., Click here to view our Data Privacy Framework: Consumer Privacy Policy.
For non-EEA and UK data, we perform such transfers based on your consent, or on our contracts, where so required by local law.

This U.S. State Privacy Notice applies to “Consumers” as defined under U.S. privacy laws, specifically the California Consumer Privacy Act, including as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (“CCPA”), the Virginia Consumer Data Privacy Act (“VCDPA”),the Colorado Privacy Act, the Utah Consumer Privacy Act, Connecticut’s Act Concerning Personal Data Privacy and Online Monitoring, and any other U.S. privacy laws, as each are amended and as and when they become effective, and including any regulations thereunder (collectively, the “U.S. Privacy Laws”). This U.S. State Privacy Notice is a supplement to this Privacy Policy. In the event of a conflict between any other P&G policy, statement, or notice and this U.S. State Privacy Notice, this U.S. State Privacy Notice will prevail as to Consumers and their rights under the applicable U.S. Privacy Laws.
This U.S. State Privacy Notice is designed to provide you with notice of our recent personal data practices over the prior 12 months from the “Last Updated” date of this Privacy Policy. This U.S. State Privacy Notice will be updated at least annually. This U.S. State Privacy Notice also applies to our current data practices such that it is also meant to provide you with “notice at collection,” which is notice of personal data (also referred to in some of the U.S. Privacy Laws as “personal information”) we collect online and offline, and the purposes for which we process personal data, among other things required by the U.S. Privacy Laws. For any new or substantially different processing activities that are not described in this U.S. State Privacy Notice, we will notify you as required by the U.S. Privacy Laws, including by either notifying you at the time of collecting personal data, or by updating this U.S. State Privacy Notice earlier than required. We reserve the right to amend this U.S. State Privacy Notice at our discretion and at any time. To contact us about this U.S. Privacy Notice, please see the
Contact Us
section below.
Generally, we collect, retain, use, and disclose your personal data for our business purposes and commercial purposes, which are described above in the remainder of this Privacy Policy, including in “
How We Gather & Use Personal Data
,”and “
How We Disclose Personal Data
” (collectively, our “Processing Purposes”). The sources from which we collect personal data are set forth above in the “
How We Gather & Use Personal Data
.” Some of the Processing Purposes, as we discuss below in the table, implicate “Sale,” “Sharing”, and or “Targeted Advertising.” For more details on the meaning of Sale, Sharing, and Targeted Advertising, see the “
Do Not Sell/Share/Target
” section below. Please note that the Processing Purposes as shown in the table are categorical descriptions, to aid in readability and clarity. Please reference the “
General Ways We Use Personal Data
” section of the Privacy Policy above for the full description of each Processing Purpose.
The table below describes the categories of personal data we collect in the first column (starting on the left). The second column provides examples of data types within the applicable categories, which, in some instances, include the personal data types/categories listed above under “
Types of Personal Data We Collect
.” The third column states the categories of recipients that receive such personal data (including sensitive personal data or special category data) as part of disclosures for business purposes, as well as disclosures which may be considered a Sale or Share under certain U.S. Privacy Laws. Not all data indicated in the examples is “sold” to third parties. For example, in the “Identifiers and Contact Information” of the chart, we may collect “financial account data” or “government issues IDs” in order to provide services to you, but we do not “sell” it to third parties. However, we may sell “unique IDs” and account information to third parties. If any of your data is “sold” or “shared,” it will be done so according to applicable law. The fourth column provides the Processing Purposes that are applicable to each category of personal data. In the fifth column, we provide, on a per category of personal data basis, the applicable retention period.

Consumer Rights Requests
As described in further detail below, subject to meeting the requirements for a Verifiable Consumer Request (defined below), we provide Consumers – which are, for clarity, residents of certain states – the privacy rights described in this section. For residents of states without Consumer privacy rights, we will consider requests but will apply our discretion in how we process such requests. For states that have passed consumer privacy laws, but are not yet in effect, we will also consider applying state law rights prior to the effective date of such laws but will do so in our discretion.
Making a Request and Scope of Requests
As permitted by the U.S. Privacy Laws, certain requests you submit to us are subject to an identity verification process (“Verifiable Consumer Request”) as described below in the “Verifying Your Request” section below. We will not fulfill such requests unless you have provided sufficient information for us to reasonably verify you are the Consumer about whom we collected personal information.
To make a request, please submit your request to us by one of the methods below. For further instructions on how to submit a Do Not Sell/Share/Target request, for non-cookie PI (as defined below), please go to the “
Do Not Sell/Share/Target
” section below.
Calling us at (877) 701-0404 
Visiting our Preference Center (which can be reached by the “Your Privacy Choices” link in the footer of our websites or via the Settings menu in our mobile applications)
Some personal data we maintain about you is not sufficiently associated with enough of your other personal data for us to be able to verify that it is your particular personal data (e.g., clickstream data tied only to a pseudonymous browser ID). We do not include that personal data in response to those requests. If we deny a verified request, we will explain the reasons in our response. You are not required to create a password-protected account with us to make a Verifiable Consumer Request. We will use personal data provided in a Verifiable Consumer Request only to verify your identity or authority to make the request and to track and document request responses unless you also gave it to us for another purpose.
We will make commercially reasonable efforts to identify personal data that we collect, process, store, disclose, and otherwise use and to respond to your privacy requests. We will typically not charge a fee to fully respond to your requests; provided, however, we may refuse to act upon a request, if your request is excessive, repetitive, unfounded, or overly burdensome. If we determine that we may refuse a request, we will give you notice explaining why we made that decision.
Verifying Your Request
To help protect your privacy and maintain security, we take steps to verify your identity before granting you access to your personal data or considering your deletion request. Upon receipt of your request, we will send you a verification form by email or postal mail. To complete your request, please respond to the verification form when you receive it. To verify your identity, we may require you to provide any of the following information: Name, email address, postal address, or date of birth.
We will review the information provided as part of your request and may ask you to provide additional information via e-mail or other means as part of this verification process. We will not fulfill your Right to Know (Categories), Right to Know (Specific Pieces/Portability), Right to Delete, or Right to Correction request unless you have provided sufficient information for us to reasonably verify you are the Consumer about whom we collected personal data. The same verification process does not apply to opt-outs of Sale or Sharing, or limitation of sensitive personal data or special category data requests, but we may apply some verification measures if we suspect fraud.
The verification standards we are required to apply for each type of request vary. We verify your categories requests and certain deletion and correction requests (e.g., those that are less sensitive in nature) to a reasonable degree of certainty, which may include matching at least two data points provided by you with data points maintained by us, which we have determined to be reliable for the purpose of verifying you. For certain deletion and correction requests (such as those that relate to personal data that is more sensitive in nature) and for specific pieces requests, we apply a verification standard of reasonably high degree of certainty. This standard includes matching at least three data points provided by you with data points maintained by us, which we have determined to be reliable for the purpose of verifying you, and may include obtaining a signed declaration from you, under penalty of perjury, that you are the individual whose personal data is the subject of the request.
If we cannot verify you in respect of certain requests, such as if you do not provide the requested information, we will still take certain actions as required by certain U.S. Privacy Laws. For example:
If we cannot verify your deletion request, we will refer you to this U.S. State Privacy Notice for a general description of our data practices.
If we cannot verify your specific pieces request, we will treat it as a categories request.
Authorizing an Agent
You may designate an authorized agent to submit a request on your behalf by submitting a request in the manners described above. If you are an authorized agent who would like to make a request, the U.S. Privacy Laws require that we ensure that a request made by an agent is a Verifiable Consumer Request (except Do Not Sell/Share requests) and allow us to request further information to ensure that the Consumer has authorized you to make the request on their behalf. Generally, we will request that an agent provide proof that the Consumer gave the agent signed permission to submit the request, and, as permitted under the U.S. Privacy Laws, we also may require the Consumer to either verify their own identity or directly confirm with us that they provided the agent permission to submit the request. To make a request as an authorized agent on behalf of a Consumer, click here.
Appeal Rights
You may appeal a denial of your request by clicking here.
Right to Know/Access
Right to Know–- Categories Request
You have the right to request, twice in a 12-month period, the following information about the personal information we have collected about you during the past 12 months:
the categories of personal information we have collected about you;
the categories of sources from which we collected the personal information;
the business or commercial purposes for which we collected or sold the personal information;
the categories of third parties to whom we sold or shared the personal information, by category or categories of personal information for each category of third parties to whom the personal information was sold or shared;
the categories of personal information about you that we disclosed for a business purpose, and the categories of persons to whom disclosed that information for a business purpose.
Right to Know–- Specific Pieces
You have the right to request a transportable copy of the specific pieces of personal data we collected about you in the 12-month period preceding your request. Please note that personal data is retained by us for various time periods, so there may be certain information that we have collected about you that we do not even retain for 12 months (and thus, it would not be able to be included in our response to you). Please also note that you may be limited under your applicable state’s law to making a certain number of “right to know” requests in any 12-month period.
Right to Delete
In addition, you have the right to request that we delete certain personal information we have collected from you. Please understand that P&G cannot delete personal data in those situations where our retention is required for our own internal business purposes or otherwise permitted by relevant U.S. Privacy Laws (such as fraud prevention or legal compliance). In these situations, we will retain your personal data in accordance with our records retention program and securely delete it at the end of the retention period.
Right to Correct
You have the right to request that we correct inaccuracies that you find in your personal data maintained by us. Your request to correct is subject to our verification (discussed above) and the response standards in the applicable U.S. Privacy Laws.
Right to Limit Sensitive Personal Data Processing
Certain personal data qualifies as “sensitive personal data” or “sensitive personal information” or “special category data” under U.S. Privacy Laws, which we refer to in this U.S. State Privacy Notice as “sensitive personal data or special category data”. Some U.S Privacy Laws require consent for the processing of sensitive personal data or special category data, which can be revoked, subject to certain exceptions and exemptions (for example, if the processing of your sensitive personal data or special category data is required to provide a product or service specifically requested by you). Depending on your state of residence, you have the right to revoke such consent, if applicable, and/or direct businesses to limit their use and disclosure of sensitive personal data or special category data if they use or disclose it beyond certain internal business purposes. You can make a request using the methods set forth above.
Rights as to Automated Decision-Making and Profiling
You have the right to opt-out of profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects. However, as discussed
above
, we do not carry out profiling or automated decision-making activities in a manner that requires us to provide opt-out rights.
Do Not Sell/Share/Target
Under the various U.S. Privacy Laws, Consumers have the right to opt-out of certain processing activities. Some states have opt-outs specific to Targeted Advertising activities - which California’s law refers to as “cross-context behavioral advertising”, and others simply as Targeted Advertising - which involve the use of personal data from different businesses or services to target advertisements to you. California provides Consumers the right to opt-out of Sharing, which includes providing or making available personal information to third parties for such Targeted Advertising activities, while other states provide Consumers the right to opt-out from processing personal information for Targeted Advertising more broadly. There are broad and differing concepts of the Sale of personal data under the various U.S. Privacy Laws, all of which at a minimum require providing or otherwise making available personal data to a third party.
When you provide us personal data for the below Processing Purposes, we may use some or all of that personal data to advertise to you. This may include making available your personal data collected during these Processing Purposes to third parties in way that may constitute a Sale and/or Sharing, as well as using your personal data for purposes of Targeted Advertising.

Giving access to personal data on our websites or apps, or otherwise, to Third-Party Digital Businesses could be deemed a Sale and/or Sharing and could implicate processing for purposes of Targeted Advertising under some U.S. Privacy Laws. Therefore, we will treat such personal data collected by Third-Party Digital Businesses (e.g., cookie ID, IP address, and other online IDs and internet or other electronic activity information) as such, and subject to the opt-out requests described above. In some instances, the personal data we make available about you is collected directly by such Third-Party Digital Businesses using Tracking Technologies on our websites or apps, or our advertisements that are served on third-party sites (which we refer to as “cookie PI”). However, certain personal data which we make available to Third Party Digital Businesses is information that we have previously collected directly from you or otherwise about you, such as your email address (which we refer to below as “non-cookie PI”).
When you opt-out pursuant to the instructions below, it will have the effect of opting you out of Sale, Sharing, and Targeted Advertising, such that our opt-out process is intended to combine all of these state opt-outs into a single opt-out. Instructions for opting out are below. Please note that there are distinct instructions for opting out of cookie PI and non-cookie PI, which we explain further, below.
Opt-out for non-cookie PI: If you would like to submit a request to opt-out of our processing of your non-cookie PI (e.g., your email address) for Targeted Advertising, or opt-out of the Sale or Sharing of such data, make an opt-out request here.
Opt-out for cookie PI: If you would like to submit a request to opt-out of our processing of your cookie PI for Targeted Advertising or opt-out of the Sale/Sharing of such personal data, you need to exercise a separate opt-out request on our cookie management tool. To do so, click “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information / Opt-Out of Targeted Advertising” in the footer of each of our websites and/or in the Settings menu of each of our mobile applications.  Then follow the instructions for the toggle. This is because we have to use different technologies to apply your opt-outs of cookie PI and of non-cookie PI. Our cookie management tool enables you to exercise such an opt-out request and enable certain cookie preferences on your device.
You must exercise your preferences separately on each of our websites that you visit, within each of our mobile applications that you use, if you use a different browser than the one on which you originally opted out, and on each device that you use. Since your browser opt-out is designated by a cookie, if you clear or block cookies, your preferences will no longer be affective, and you will need to enable them again via our cookie management tool.
For more information about how we have shared your personal data with third parties such that it constitutes a “Sale” or “Share” under CCPA during the 12-month period prior to the date this privacy policy was last updated, please refer to the chart above. We do not knowingly Sell or Share personal data of minors older than 13 years of age and under 16 years of age without their consent.
Global Privacy Control (“GPC”)
Some of the U.S. Privacy Laws require businesses to process GPC signals, which is referred to in some states as opt-out preference signals and in other states as universal opt-out mechanisms. GPC is a signal sent by a platform, technology, or mechanism, enabled by individuals on their devices or browsers, that communicate the individual’s choice to opt-out of the Sale and Sharing of personal data, or of processing of personal data for Targeted Advertising. To use GPC, you can download an internet browser or a plugin to use on your current internet browser and follow the settings to enable the GPC. We have configured the settings of our consent management platform to receive and process GPC signals on our website and mobile applications, which is explained by our consent management platform here.
Certain of the U.S. Privacy Laws require us to explain how we process GPC signals in detail, specifically how we apply GPC signals and the corresponding Do Not Sell/Share/Target requests to online data (what we refer to above as “cookie PI”) and offline data (what we refer to above as “non-cookie PI”). Below we explain the scenarios in which we apply the Do Not Sell/Share/Target requests communicated by GPC signals to cookie PI and, where applicable, to non-cookie PI:
• When you are visiting our website on a particular internet browser (“browser 1”), we will apply the GPC signal and corresponding Do Not Sell/Share/Target to cookie PI collected on that browser 1.
• When you log in on browser 1: We will be able to apply the GPC signal and corresponding Do Not Sell/Share/Target request to non-cookie PI associated with your user account, but only if and after you have logged into your user account on browser 1.
When you visit our website on a different browser (“browser 2""). If you later visit our website on browser 2 (whether on the same device or a different device) and GPC is not enabled, we are unable to apply the prior GPC signal from browser 1 to cookie PI on browser 2, unless and until you login to your user account on browser 2. We will continue to apply the Do Not Sell/Share/Target opt-outs communicated via the GPC signal on browser 1.
We process GPC signals in a frictionless manner, which means that we do not: (1) charge a fee for use of our service if you have enabled GPC; (2) change your experience with our website if you use GPC; or (3) display a notification, pop-up, text, graphic, animation, sound, video, or any interstitial in response to the GPC.
Incentive and Loyalty Programs; Right to Non-Discrimination
Loyalty/Incentive Programs Notice
We also collect and use your personal data to administer and maintain Rewards Programs (defined above in “
How We Gather & Use Personal Data
”), which may be considered a “financial incentive” or a “bona fide loyalty program” under one or more of the U.S. Privacy Laws.
We use all categories of personal data disclosed in the above table, excluding “biometric information,” “professional or employment information, and “non-public education records,” to administer and maintain such Rewards Programs. All categories of personal data we use for loyalty programs may also be Sold or processed for Targeted Advertising. We may also use, Sell, and process for Targeted Advertising the categories of sensitive personal data or special category data: account information and credentials, precise geolocation data, racial or ethnic origin, and personal data concerning health. While we may collect sensitive personal data or special category data in relation to some Rewards Programs, the collection and processing of sensitive personal data or special category data is not required to participate in Rewards Programs. We use personal data to verify your identity, offer unique rewards, track your program status, and to facilitate the exchange of program points for products, promotional materials, training workshops, and other items. The categories of third parties that will receive personal data and sensitive personal data or special category data are set forth in the table above, some of which may qualify as data brokers under some of the U.S. Privacy Laws. Some U.S. Privacy Laws require us to state whether we provide Rewards Programs benefits through third-party partners; however, while we sometimes will provide you the opportunity to independently engage with third parties through our websites or apps, third parties do not provide Rewards Programs on our behalf.
You can opt-in to a Rewards Program by signing up on the applicable rewards page. If you opt-in to participate in any of our Rewards Programs, you may withdraw from participation at any time by contacting us using the contact details in this Privacy Policy or in accordance with the instructions set forth in the applicable Rewards Program’s terms and conditions.
Under certain U.S. Privacy Laws, you may be entitled to be informed as to why financial incentive programs, or price or service differences, are permitted under the law, including (i) a good-faith estimate of the value of your personal data that forms the basis for offering the financial incentive or price or service difference, and (ii) a description of the method we used to calculate the value of your personal data. Generally, we do not assign monetary or other value to personal data. However, in the event we are required by law to assign such value in the context of Rewards Programs, or price or service differences, we have valued the personal data collected and used as being equal to the value of the discount or benefit provided, and the calculation of the value is based upon a practical and good-faith effort often involving the (i) categories of personal data collected (e.g., names, email addresses), (ii) the use of such personal data for our marketing and business purposes in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our Rewards Programs, (iii) the discounted price offered (if any), (iv) the volume of consumers enrolled in our Rewards Programs, and (v) the product or service to which the Rewards Programs, or price or service differences, applies. The disclosure of the value described herein is not intended to waive, nor should be interpreted as a waiver to, our proprietary or business confidential information, including trade secrets, and does not constitute any representation with regard to generally accepted accounting principles or financial accounting standards. We deem the value of the personal data to be reasonably related to the value of the rewards, and by subscribing to these Rewards Programs you indicate you agree. If you do not, do not subscribe to the Rewards Programs.
Non-Discrimination
You have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment for the exercise of your privacy rights described in this U.S. State Privacy Notice. We will not deny, charge different prices for, or provide a different level or quality of goods or services in a manner that is prohibited by the U.S. Privacy Laws if you choose to exercise your rights. Please note, however, that you will no longer be able to participate in Rewards Programs request to delete personal data. This is because we need the personal data collected in relation Rewards Program to carry out the functions described above.

How You Control Your Personal Data
You are in control of your personal data. You can exercise your rights and change your preferences anytime.
Data Subject Rights Requests
Depending on your location (the jurisdiction in which you are a resident), you may have different data subject rights available to you. These may include requests for access, erasure, rectification/correction, to opt out of receiving marketing emails or texts, object to our use of your email address or phone number for advertising, etc. To submit a Data Subject Rights requests for your jurisdiction, click here.
You can also tell us to stop sending you email and text messages by following the opt-out instructions sent with these communications. Please be aware that we may need to keep certain information to honor your choices (e.g., if you tell us to stop sending marketing emails, we will need your email address on file so that our systems remember that you no longer wish to receive marketing communications to that email address).
Also, there are some situations where we may be unable to grant your request (e.g., deleting transaction data where we have a legal obligation to keep it, or for fraud prevention, security, or to protect the privacy of others, or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims, among other things). 
Traditional Online Behavioral Advertising
How you exercise choice as to interest-based ads
Advertising Industry Opt-Outs
For the U.S., to exercise choice with respect to interest-based advertising, you can utilize the opt-out mechanism provided by the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) by clicking here (for browsers) or here (for app-based opt-outs).
The Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) has developed a tool that allows consumers to opt out of certain Interest-based Ads delivered by NAI members' ad networks. To learn more about opting out of such targeted advertising or to use the NAI tool, see http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/.
For Europe, you may click here to learn more about the DAA-Europe’s opt-out program.
For Canada, you may click here to learn more about the DAA Canada’s opt-out program.
To opt-out of Unified ID 2.0 globally click here.
Online Platform Opt-Outs
P&G may share identifiers connected to you, such as a hashed version of your email address, with online platforms, including but not limited to those listed below, for the purpose of sending you interest-based advertising. To learn more about how these platforms may use your data and about how you can control the use of this data, please follow the links below.
Google
Meta
Microsoft / Bing
Pinterest
Reddit
Snap
TikTok
Please be aware that, even if you opt-out of certain kinds of interest-based ads, you may continue to receive other ads. Further, opting out of one or more NAI or DAA members only means that those selected members should no longer under the DAA / NAI rules deliver certain targeted ads to you. This will affect services provided by the applicable DAA / NAI members but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads from non-participating parties. Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit the opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different Device or web browser(s), or use a non-browser-based method of access, your DAA / NAI browser-based opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective. Mobile device opt-outs will not affect browser-based Interest-based ads even on the same device, and you must opt-out separately for each device. We are not responsible for the effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third party opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.
You can also prevent or reduce getting interest-based ads on websites by declining cookies in your browser(s), or on mobile devices by declining the “access to data” requests that apps usually present when you install them or by adjusting the ad tracking settings on your device.
Please note that you may also receive personalized ads based on your email address or phone number, if you have provided those to us for marketing purposes. To opt out of that usage, please contact us here (Note: Please ensure you select the correct location / country of your residence by clicking the button in the top left corner).
You will still see “contextual” ads even if you opt out of interest-based ads. Even if we stop sending you interest-based ads, you will still get ads from our brands on your computer or mobile devices. These ads, however, are based on the context of the sites you visit and are called contextual ads. Unlike interest-based ads which are based on pages you visit on your mobile phone or computer viewing activities over time and across unrelated services, contextual ads are ads shown to you based on the context of the specific site you are visiting. For example, you still may see an ad for one of our baby care brands while looking at nursery products online because these sites traditionally have had mostly new or expecting parents as visitors. You should also know that we may still collect information from your computer or devices and use it for other purposes like evaluating how our websites work, for consumer research, or detecting fraud, pursuant to applicable laws.
How You Can Control Cookies
You can set your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent to your computer. However, this may prevent our sites or services from working properly. You can also set your browser to delete cookies every time you finish browsing.
When you opt-out of interest-based advertising, an opt-out cookie is sent to your browser that indicates that you no longer want to receive interest-based ads. Your opt-out cookie will be deleted if you decide to delete all cookies on your browser. This means that you will need to opt-out again on each browser where you have deleted cookies if you still do not want to receive interest-based ads.
In some markets and on some of our websites, we offer a cookie consent management platform which allows you to exercise choice with respect to certain categories of cookies. If this is available, this may appear as a cookie banner and/or as an icon that is visible on the applicable websites. We may also provide similar technology in mobile apps, which, if available, will be accessible through the applicable app’s settings menu.
U.S. State Privacy Laws
See our “
U.S. State Privacy Notice
“ below for information required by certain state privacy laws, and information regarding privacy rights under such laws.
Additional Information for EEA, Switzerland, UK and Serbia Residents
If you live in the EEA, Switzerland, the UK or Serbia, or are physically in the EEA, Switzerland, Serbia or the UK, you may access the personal data we hold about you, request that inaccurate, outdated, or no longer necessary information be corrected, erased, or restricted, and ask us to provide your data in a format that allows you to transfer it to another service provider. You also may withdraw your consent at any time where we are relying on your consent for the processing of your personal data. And you may object to our processing of your personal data (this means ask us to stop using it) where that processing is based on our legitimate interest (this means we have a legitimate reason for using the data for a certain purpose and this reason is not outweighed by your interest in P&G not using it). To make a request, please contact us.
If you would like more information about data protection and your personal data rights in general, please visit the European Data Protection Supervisor’s site at https://edps.europa.eu/data-protection/ or the UK Information Commissioner’s Office site at https://ico.org.uk or the or the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner site at https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html the Serbia Commissioner (for information of public importance and personal data protection of personal data) at https://www.poverenik.rs/en/home.html. If you are not happy with our response to your requests, you may lodge a complaint with the data protection authority in your country.

How We Gather & Use Personal Data
Like most brands, we collect personal data as you interact with us or when you share personal data with third parties that in turn can be shared with us. We do this respectfully and carefully to protect your rights. Personal data can help us better understand your interests and preferences as a consumer and a person.
How We Collect Personal Data
We collect personal data about you in many ways and from many places. Some of the personal data we collect may include personal data that can be used to identify you; for example, your name, email address, telephone number, or postal address. In some jurisdictions, things like IP address or cookie and mobile device identifiers may also be considered personal data. Some of the personal data we collect may be considered sensitive personal data or special category data and may include, account login information, financial information, precise geolocation data, government identifiers, racial or ethnic origin, mental & physical health / condition, Consumer Health Data, sex life or sexual orientation, transgender / non binary status, children’s data, criminal background, genetic data and biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying an individual etc.
You Share it Directly
You give us your personal data directly for example when signing up for an account on our websites or mobile apps or by calling or emailing us, or while participating in a P&G survey or contest etc. We may ask for things like your name, email or home address, date of birth, payment information, your age, gender, the number of people in your family, and the way you want us to send you information about our products and services—for example, to your home address, email address, or by texting you.
You Interact with Websites & Emails
We may use technologies that automatically collect information when you visit our sites, view our advertisements, or use our products or services. For example, we use cookies (a tiny file stored on your computer’s browser) to tell us what browser and operating system you are using, your IP address, and about your online activities such as web pages you visit, links you click, or whether you have or have not opened an email from us.
You Use Mobile Apps & Other Devices
To give you the best possible user experience, we may use technologies that collect information from your phone when you use our mobile apps or our “smart” devices in your home. You consent to this when downloading the app or installing household internet connected devices. This information could include your mobile phone or other device advertising ID, information about your phone’s operating system, how you use the app or device, your physical location, and other information that is considered personal data in some jurisdictions. You will get a pop-up notice on your phone or device that gives you the option to accept or reject allowing us to know your precise geolocation (exactly where you are standing or where you are accessing the internet) or to collect or access other personal data, as required by the applicable laws.
You Connect with Partners or Third Parties
We may get information that other companies share with or sell to us. For example, you may have given consent for another company to share your personal data with us when you signed up for telecom services or a retailer loyalty points program. Where possible, we may also collect personal data from publicly available sources, such as from internet postings, blog entries, videos, or social media sites. We may also receive personal data from other companies, such as consumer data resellers, who are in the business of collecting or aggregating information about you sourced from publicly available databases (in line with local legal requirements as applicable) or from consent you have given to their use and subsequently our use of your personal data. This might include information about your income level, age, gender, number of people in your family, and products you have bought on the internet or from stores in your neighborhood.

How We Use Cookies
Cookies are small files sent to your computer as you surf the web. They store useful information about how you interact with the websites you visit. You can learn more about how to control cookies
here
.
We use cookies in several ways, such as:
to allow you to browse the website and use its features
to serve you with relevant advertising and measure the effectiveness of such advertising
to ensure that you are not shown an ad more than you should be (called “frequency capping”)
to learn more about the way you interact with P&G content
to help us improve your experience when visiting our websites
to remember your preferences, such as a language or a region, so there is no need for you to customize the website on each visit
to identify errors and resolve them
to analyze how well our websites are performing
Types of Cookies We Use
Strictly Necessary Cookies:  These cookies (also sometimes referred to as “essential”) allow the page to load or provide some essential functionality without which the page would not work (i.e., store your data in a shopping cart).
Functional Cookies:  These cookies allow sites to remember what you prefer when you come back again. For example, if you choose to read the site in French on your first visit, the next time you come back the site will appear automatically in French. Not having to select a language preference every time makes it more convenient, more efficient, and user-friendly for you.
Advertising / Targeting Cookies: These cookies can be used to learn about what interests you generally might have, based, for example, on the websites you visit and the products you buy. That data allows us to send you ads for products and services that better fit the things you like or need. It also allows us to limit the number of times you see the same advertisement.
Analytics / Performance Cookies: These cookies tell us how you use our websites, like which pages you visited and which links you clicked. This helps us measure and improve the performance of our websites. We use different analytics cookies in different jurisdictions. In many cases, we use Google Analytics cookies to monitor the performance of our sites. Our ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to our sites is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy.
Social Media Cookies: These cookies, that are set by a range of social media services that we have added to the site, allow you to share our content with your friends and networks and enable us to reach you with ads on those social platforms related to your visits on our sites. The cookies of some social media sites, e.g., Facebook, are also used for ad targeting.
Interest-Based Advertising
When you visit our partner sites, we can show you ads or other content we believe you would like to see. For example, you may receive advertisements for Tide® laundry detergent if we notice that you are visiting sites that sell children’s clothing or school supplies. And from that information we may conclude that you have children and therefore could well be interested in a powerful laundry-cleaning product. In this way, we intend to send you relevant information about our products that might be of benefit to you. To learn more about your choices regarding interest-based advertising go
here
.
We Learn from Groups of Consumers Sharing Similar Interests:  We may place you into a particular group of consumers who show the same interests. For example, we may put you in the group of “razor aficionados” if we see you frequently purchase razors online or you could be a “bargain-shopper” if we notice you use online coupons or look for discounts or sales. We may infer these things about you based on your activity on certain web pages, links you click on our websites and other websites you visit, mobile applications you use, or our brand emails you view and links you click in the emails, as well based on other information we have collected, such as from retailer partners and other third parties. We group together cookie and device IDs to help us learn about general trends, habits, or characteristics from a group of consumers who all act similarly online and/or offline. By doing this, we can find and serve many others who “look like” those already in the group and thereby send them what we believe will be relevant and beneficial product offers and information.
We Link Other Information to Your Cookie and Device IDs:  Your cookie and device IDs may be supplemented with other information, such as information about the products you buy offline or information that you provide directly to us when creating an account on our sites. We generally do this in ways that will not directly personally identify you. For example, we could know that cookie ID ABC12345 belongs to the razor aficionado group based on a person’s web site visits, age, gender, and shopping habits. Should we want to personally identify your cookie or device information (web and app viewing history), we will do so in accordance with applicable laws.
We May Know You Across Your Computers, Tablets, Phones and Devices:  We may know that cookie ID ABC12345 is from a computer that that may be connected to the same person or household owning the mobile phone with device ID EFG15647. This means that you may search for diapers on your laptop, click on a Google search result link which we have sponsored, and then later see an ad for our Pampers® brand diapers on your mobile phone. We might assume or deduce that the same person owns the computer and phone because, for example, they sign on to the same Wi-Fi network every day at the same time. Understanding what devices seem to be used by a person or household helps us limit the number of times you see the same ad across your devices. And this is important because that way you don’t get annoyed at us for spamming you with the same ad and we don’t pay for such repetitive ads that we don’t want you to receive.
Addressable Media: When you provide us with your personal data via our sites or apps, we may use an encryption of that data – or a substitute identifier such as The Trade Desk's UID2 -- to serve you with ads we think you may like. We do this generally by uploading a pseudonymized version (replaced with artificial letters or numbers) of your email address, phone number, or your mobile advertising ID to a platform that offers ad space (e.g., Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, etc.). We also use that same data to serve you advertising through what is called the open web. This means you may see relevant ads from us on sites like nytimes.com or apps or other places like digital TV that participate in online auctions of their ad inventory.
Advanced Matching: Some of our sites use the Advanced Matching features offered by Social Media Platforms to its advertisers (e.g. Facebook’s Advanced Matching, TikTok’s Advanced Matching, etc.). Through Advanced Matching, we may send some of the personal data you enter on our site form fields (e.g., your name, email address, and phone number – not any sensitive personal data or special category data) in a pseudonymized format to the Social Media Platform, or the Social Media Platform Pixel will pseudonymize and pull that data automatically, for the purpose of helping associate you with your browser cookie or device ID. We do this so that we can better target and measure the effectiveness of our advertising on the respective Social Media platforms. This is how we can know that if we showed you an ad on a given Social Media Platform, you clicked on it, came to our site and bought something – or not – and therefore whether we should continue to buy ads on that Social Media Platform – or not.
Google Analytics Advertising Features: Some of our sites use Google Remarketing Lists for Search Ads with Analytics (“RLSA”), which is a service they offer to advertisers. When individuals visit our sites, Google Analytics collects data about their visits (and not any sensitive personal data or special category data). If a visitor is signed into their Google account, we are able to provide that user with interest-based advertising when they conduct a Google search for terms related to the P&G site they visited. For example, if you are signed into a Google account when visiting our Head & Shoulders website, we may provide you with Head & Shoulders advertising when you search for “dandruff shampoo” on Google. Our ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to our sites is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy. To understand how Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps, visit here. You may opt out of Google Analytics at any time.
Other Technologies We May Use
Proximity-Based Beacons:  Beacons send one-way signals to mobile apps you install on your phone over very short distances to tell you, for example, what products are on-sale as you walk through a store. Beacons only talk to your device when you get close enough and after you have given consent within the mobile application associated with a particular beacon. In turn, apps may provide us location information to help customize advertising and offers to you. For example, when you are near a beacon in the skin care section of a supermarket, we may send you a $4 off coupon.
Pixels: These are small objects embedded into a web page but are not visible. They are also known as ""tags,” “web bugs,” or ""pixel gifs."" We may use pixels to deliver cookies to your computer, monitor our website activity, make logging into our sites easier, and for online marketing activities. We may also include pixels in our promotional email messages or newsletters to determine whether you open them and click on their links. This helps us understand whether you are an active user (which will prevent your data from being deleted due to inactivity). It also helps us measure the effectiveness of our marketing efforts, and derive insights and analysis, that we will use to personalize the content of our communication and to guide our marketing decisions (for example, if you opened an email but did not click on the links in it, we may decide to retarget you on Facebook).
Mobile Device Identifiers and SDKs:  We use software code in our mobile apps to collect information as you use our apps which is like what cookies collect on our websites. This will be information like your mobile phone identifiers (iOS IDFAs and Android Advertising IDs) and the way you use our apps.
Precise Geolocation:  We may receive information about your exact location from things like global positioning system (GPS) coordinates (longitude and latitude) when you use our mobile apps. You will always get a pop-up notice on your phone or device asking for you to accept or reject allowing us to know exactly where you are in the world. You should understand that we will not always ask for consent to know generally that you are in a broader city, postal code, or province. For example, we do not consider it to be precise location if all we know is that you are somewhere in Manila, Philippines.
Site and App Content
Plugins:  Our websites may include plugins from other companies such as social networks. An example of a plugin is the Facebook “Like” button. These plugins may collect information (e.g., the URL of the page you visited) and send it back to the company that created them. This may happen even if you do not click on the plugin. These plugins are governed by the privacy policy and terms of the company that created them, even though they appear on our sites.
Logins:  Our websites may allow you to log in using your account with another company such as, for example, “Login with Facebook.” When you do this, we will have access only to the information that you have given us consent to receive from your account settings in the other company’s account you’re using to log in with.
User Content:  Some of our sites and apps will allow you to upload your own content for contests, blogs, videos, and other functions. Please remember that any information you submit or post becomes public information. We do not have control over how others may use the content you submit to our sites and apps. We are not responsible for such uses in ways that may violate this privacy policy, the law, or your personal privacy and safety.
Links:  P&G sites may include links to other sites, which we do not control. Those sites will be governed by their own privacy policies and terms, not ours.
Automated Decision-Making and Profiling
Automated decision-making implies making a decision using automated means without human involvement. Profiling is a form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal characteristics of an individual for the purpose of analyzing or predicting, for example, that individual’s personal preferences, interests, likely behavior, etc.
As you have read in this Privacy Policy, we collect a variety of types of personal data both from you and from other commercially available sources. This data may be combined and analyzed, including sometimes using algorithms, to identify links between certain behaviors and personal characteristics. P&G users who have similar characteristics or have performed similar actions are likely to share similar interests in our products: based on this analysis, segments of P&G consumers are created and targeted accordingly with relevant offers via email, online advertising, and social media.
This process allows us to customize our communications to your declared or inferred interests. However, we will not conduct any automated decision-making processes, including profiling, that can produce legal effects or that can similarly significantly affect your rights and freedoms, as per Art. 22(1) and (4) of the GDPR and, should we want to engage in more intrusive profiling and tracking practices, we will always inform you and, where legally required, ask for your consent before doing so or provide you with the right to opt-out.
How We Disclose Personal Data
With Your Consent
When we have your consent, we may disclose your personal data to others, such as select partners so they can send you offers, promotions, or ads about products or services we believe you may be interested in. For example, people who receive P&G emails from our diaper brands such as Pampers® may also consent to hear about baby formulas from other companies.
Online Platforms and Ad Tech Companies
Our websites and applications may make available contact information, unique identifiers, inferred and derived information, online and technical information and geolocation data with online platforms and ad tech companies to help us serve you relevant advertisements and offers, subject to applicable legal requirements, which may include consent and/or opt-outs.  We do not sell your personal data to marketers outside of P&G in exchange for monetary compensation. Please see the U.S. State Privacy Notice section of the privacy policy below for additional information.
Vendors
We may disclose or otherwise make available your personal data to our vendors (including “service providers” and “processors” defined under applicable laws, which we collectively refer to as “service providers” or “vendors” herein) who help us run our business. This includes hosting our sites, processing payment information for the purchases made by you through our sites, delivering our emails and marketing communications to you, analyzing the data we collect, helping us with sales attribution (e.g., to see if we showed you an ad on a platform site and then you bought a product from us) and sending you the products and services you requested. We also disclose or otherwise make available your personal data with lawyers, auditors, consultants, information technology and security firms, and others who provide services to us. We disclose or otherwise make available only the personal data needed for these companies to complete the tasks we request or, where permitted by applicable law, use the personal data for certain internal purposes such as security or fraud detection. We instruct our service providers to appropriately process and protect your personal data.
Payments for Purchases
Payments for purchases made through some of our sites are completed using a third-party vendor’s online payment system.  For these sites, P&G does not have access to your credit card information provided for purchases and does not store or disclose your credit card information as part of your purchases through these third-party systems.

International Transfers
P&G has its head offices in the United States, regional offices in Singapore, Dubai, Geneva and Panama and further P&G service centers in other countries, like Costa Rica or Philippines. As a multinational company, P&G undertakes data transfers, either within the P&G group of entities, or when sharing your data with service providers or selected partners that may store, process, or access your data in a country other than the one in which it was collected, including the United States. Personal data collected from Quebec, for example, may be transferred outside of Canada with adequate protections and safeguards in place.
As far as EU citizens are concerned, (but also citizens of Switzerland, UK and Serbia for example) this means that their data may be processed outside of the European Economic Area (EEA), either in countries that have been recognized by the European Commission to offer adequate data protection, like the United Kingdom (from where, for example, some of our fulfillment, return and contact center services are managed for the EU region), or Switzerland (where our EU headquarters are located), or in other countries that are not deemed, by the European Commission, as offering such level of data protection. For such transfers of data, because special safeguards need to be foreseen to ensure that the protection travels with the data, we use the EU Standard Contractual Clauses, standardized and pre-approved model data protection clauses. You can find the latest version of the approved EU Standard Contractual Clauses, including the different transfer modules, here. Our transfer agreements also incorporate the standard data protection clauses issued in accordance with UK, Swiss and Serbian data protection law If you have any questions with reference to our data transfer agreements, please contact us.
If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) or Switzerland, please note that P&G is certified under the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) [collectively, the “Data Privacy Framework”] developed by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Commission and Information Commissioner and Swiss Federal Data Protection, respectively, regarding the transfer of personal information from the EEA, United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) or Switzerland to the U.S., Click here to view our Data Privacy Framework: Consumer Privacy Policy.
For non-EEA and UK data, we perform such transfers based on your consent, or on our contracts, where so required by local law.

Consumer Rights Requests
As described in further detail below, subject to meeting the requirements for a Verifiable Consumer Request (defined below), we provide Consumers – which are, for clarity, residents of certain states – the privacy rights described in this section. For residents of states without Consumer privacy rights, we will consider requests but will apply our discretion in how we process such requests. For states that have passed consumer privacy laws, but are not yet in effect, we will also consider applying state law rights prior to the effective date of such laws but will do so in our discretion.
Making a Request and Scope of Requests
As permitted by the U.S. Privacy Laws, certain requests you submit to us are subject to an identity verification process (“Verifiable Consumer Request”) as described below in the “Verifying Your Request” section below. We will not fulfill such requests unless you have provided sufficient information for us to reasonably verify you are the Consumer about whom we collected personal information.
To make a request, please submit your request to us by one of the methods below. For further instructions on how to submit a Do Not Sell/Share/Target request, for non-cookie PI (as defined below), please go to the “
Do Not Sell/Share/Target
” section below.
Calling us at (877) 701-0404 
Visiting our Preference Center (which can be reached by the “Your Privacy Choices” link in the footer of our websites or via the Settings menu in our mobile applications)
Some personal data we maintain about you is not sufficiently associated with enough of your other personal data for us to be able to verify that it is your particular personal data (e.g., clickstream data tied only to a pseudonymous browser ID). We do not include that personal data in response to those requests. If we deny a verified request, we will explain the reasons in our response. You are not required to create a password-protected account with us to make a Verifiable Consumer Request. We will use personal data provided in a Verifiable Consumer Request only to verify your identity or authority to make the request and to track and document request responses unless you also gave it to us for another purpose.
We will make commercially reasonable efforts to identify personal data that we collect, process, store, disclose, and otherwise use and to respond to your privacy requests. We will typically not charge a fee to fully respond to your requests; provided, however, we may refuse to act upon a request, if your request is excessive, repetitive, unfounded, or overly burdensome. If we determine that we may refuse a request, we will give you notice explaining why we made that decision.
Verifying Your Request
To help protect your privacy and maintain security, we take steps to verify your identity before granting you access to your personal data or considering your deletion request. Upon receipt of your request, we will send you a verification form by email or postal mail. To complete your request, please respond to the verification form when you receive it. To verify your identity, we may require you to provide any of the following information: Name, email address, postal address, or date of birth.
We will review the information provided as part of your request and may ask you to provide additional information via e-mail or other means as part of this verification process. We will not fulfill your Right to Know (Categories), Right to Know (Specific Pieces/Portability), Right to Delete, or Right to Correction request unless you have provided sufficient information for us to reasonably verify you are the Consumer about whom we collected personal data. The same verification process does not apply to opt-outs of Sale or Sharing, or limitation of sensitive personal data or special category data requests, but we may apply some verification measures if we suspect fraud.
The verification standards we are required to apply for each type of request vary. We verify your categories requests and certain deletion and correction requests (e.g., those that are less sensitive in nature) to a reasonable degree of certainty, which may include matching at least two data points provided by you with data points maintained by us, which we have determined to be reliable for the purpose of verifying you. For certain deletion and correction requests (such as those that relate to personal data that is more sensitive in nature) and for specific pieces requests, we apply a verification standard of reasonably high degree of certainty. This standard includes matching at least three data points provided by you with data points maintained by us, which we have determined to be reliable for the purpose of verifying you, and may include obtaining a signed declaration from you, under penalty of perjury, that you are the individual whose personal data is the subject of the request.
If we cannot verify you in respect of certain requests, such as if you do not provide the requested information, we will still take certain actions as required by certain U.S. Privacy Laws. For example:
If we cannot verify your deletion request, we will refer you to this U.S. State Privacy Notice for a general description of our data practices.
If we cannot verify your specific pieces request, we will treat it as a categories request.
Authorizing an Agent
You may designate an authorized agent to submit a request on your behalf by submitting a request in the manners described above. If you are an authorized agent who would like to make a request, the U.S. Privacy Laws require that we ensure that a request made by an agent is a Verifiable Consumer Request (except Do Not Sell/Share requests) and allow us to request further information to ensure that the Consumer has authorized you to make the request on their behalf. Generally, we will request that an agent provide proof that the Consumer gave the agent signed permission to submit the request, and, as permitted under the U.S. Privacy Laws, we also may require the Consumer to either verify their own identity or directly confirm with us that they provided the agent permission to submit the request.

Appeal Rights
You may appeal a denial of your request by clicking here.
Right to Know/Access
Right to Know–- Categories Request
You have the right to request, twice in a 12-month period, the following information about the personal information we have collected about you during the past 12 months:
the categories of personal information we have collected about you;
the categories of sources from which we collected the personal information;
the business or commercial purposes for which we collected or sold the personal information;
the categories of third parties to whom we sold or shared the personal information, by category or categories of personal information for each category of third parties to whom the personal information was sold or shared;
the categories of personal information about you that we disclosed for a business purpose, and the categories of persons to whom disclosed that information for a business purpose.
Right to Know–- Specific Pieces
You have the right to request a transportable copy of the specific pieces of personal data we collected about you in the 12-month period preceding your request. Please note that personal data is retained by us for various time periods, so there may be certain information that we have collected about you that we do not even retain for 12 months (and thus, it would not be able to be included in our response to you). Please also note that you may be limited under your applicable state’s law to making a certain number of “right to know” requests in any 12-month period.
Right to Delete
In addition, you have the right to request that we delete certain personal information we have collected from you. Please understand that P&G cannot delete personal data in those situations where our retention is required for our own internal business purposes or otherwise permitted by relevant U.S. Privacy Laws (such as fraud prevention or legal compliance). In these situations, we will retain your personal data in accordance with our records retention program and securely delete it at the end of the retention period.
Right to Correct
You have the right to request that we correct inaccuracies that you find in your personal data maintained by us. Your request to correct is subject to our verification (discussed above) and the response standards in the applicable U.S. Privacy Laws.
Right to Limit Sensitive Personal Data Processing
Certain personal data qualifies as “sensitive personal data” or “sensitive personal information” or “special category data” under U.S. Privacy Laws, which we refer to in this U.S. State Privacy Notice as “sensitive personal data or special category data”. Some U.S Privacy Laws require consent for the processing of sensitive personal data or special category data, which can be revoked, subject to certain exceptions and exemptions (for example, if the processing of your sensitive personal data or special category data is required to provide a product or service specifically requested by you). Depending on your state of residence, you have the right to revoke such consent, if applicable, and/or direct businesses to limit their use and disclosure of sensitive personal data or special category data if they use or disclose it beyond certain internal business purposes. You can make a request using the methods set forth above.
Rights as to Automated Decision-Making and Profiling
You have the right to opt-out of profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects. However, as discussed
above
, we do not carry out profiling or automated decision-making activities in a manner that requires us to provide opt-out rights.
Do Not Sell/Share/Target
Under the various U.S. Privacy Laws, Consumers have the right to opt-out of certain processing activities. Some states have opt-outs specific to Targeted Advertising activities - which California’s law refers to as “cross-context behavioral advertising”, and others simply as Targeted Advertising - which involve the use of personal data from different businesses or services to target advertisements to you. California provides Consumers the right to opt-out of Sharing, which includes providing or making available personal information to third parties for such Targeted Advertising activities, while other states provide Consumers the right to opt-out from processing personal information for Targeted Advertising more broadly. There are broad and differing concepts of the Sale of personal data under the various U.S. Privacy Laws, all of which at a minimum require providing or otherwise making available personal data to a third party.
When you provide us personal data for the below Processing Purposes, we may use some or all of that personal data to advertise to you. This may include making available your personal data collected during these Processing Purposes to third parties in way that may constitute a Sale and/or Sharing, as well as using your personal data for purposes of Targeted Advertising.
•
Products/Services.
•
Customer Management.
•
Customer Service/Communications,
•
Serving Ads.
•
Ads Administration,
• Purposes Disclosed at Collection
Third-Party digital businesses, including online platforms (Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc.) and AdTech companies such as Demand Side Platforms which help us place advertisements (“Third-Party Digital Businesses”) may associate cookies and other tracking technologies that collect personal data about you on our apps and websites, or otherwise collect and process personal data that we make available about you, including digital activity information. Giving access to personal data on our websites or apps, or otherwise, to Third-Party Digital Businesses could be deemed a Sale and/or Sharing and could implicate processing for purposes of Targeted Advertising under some U.S. Privacy Laws. Therefore, we will treat such personal data collected by Third-Party Digital Businesses (e.g., cookie ID, IP address, and other online IDs and internet or other electronic activity information) as such, and subject to the opt-out requests described above. In some instances, the personal data we make available about you is collected directly by such Third-Party Digital Businesses using Tracking Technologies on our websites or apps, or our advertisements that are served on third-party sites (which we refer to as “cookie PI”). However, certain personal data which we make available to Third Party Digital Businesses is information that we have previously collected directly from you or otherwise about you, such as your email address (which we refer to below as “non-cookie PI”).
When you opt-out pursuant to the instructions below, it will have the effect of opting you out of Sale, Sharing, and Targeted Advertising, such that our opt-out process is intended to combine all of these state opt-outs into a single opt-out. Instructions for opting out are below. Please note that there are distinct instructions for opting out of cookie PI and non-cookie PI, which we explain further, below.
Opt-out for non-cookie PI: If you would like to submit a request to opt-out of our processing of your non-cookie PI (e.g., your email address) for Targeted Advertising, or opt-out of the Sale or Sharing of such data, make an opt-out request here.
Opt-out for cookie PI: If you would like to submit a request to opt-out of our processing of your cookie PI for Targeted Advertising or opt-out of the Sale/Sharing of such personal data, you need to exercise a separate opt-out request on our cookie management tool. To do so, click “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information / Opt-Out of Targeted Advertising” in the footer of each of our websites and/or in the Settings menu of each of our mobile applications.  Then follow the instructions for the toggle. This is because we have to use different technologies to apply your opt-outs of cookie PI and of non-cookie PI. Our cookie management tool enables you to exercise such an opt-out request and enable certain cookie preferences on your device.
You must exercise your preferences separately on each of our websites that you visit, within each of our mobile applications that you use, if you use a different browser than the one on which you originally opted out, and on each device that you use. Since your browser opt-out is designated by a cookie, if you clear or block cookies, your preferences will no longer be affective, and you will need to enable them again via our cookie management tool.
For more information about how we have shared your personal data with third parties such that it constitutes a “Sale” or “Share” under CCPA during the 12-month period prior to the date this privacy policy was last updated, please refer to the chart above. We do not knowingly Sell or Share personal data of minors older than 13 years of age and under 16 years of age without their consent.
Global Privacy Control (“GPC”)
Some of the U.S. Privacy Laws require businesses to process GPC signals, which is referred to in some states as opt-out preference signals and in other states as universal opt-out mechanisms. GPC is a signal sent by a platform, technology, or mechanism, enabled by individuals on their devices or browsers, that communicate the individual’s choice to opt-out of the Sale and Sharing of personal data, or of processing of personal data for Targeted Advertising. To use GPC, you can download an internet browser or a plugin to use on your current internet browser and follow the settings to enable the GPC. We have configured the settings of our consent management platform to receive and process GPC signals on our website and mobile applications, which is explained by our consent management platform here.
Certain of the U.S. Privacy Laws require us to explain how we process GPC signals in detail, specifically how we apply GPC signals and the corresponding Do Not Sell/Share/Target requests to online data (what we refer to above as “cookie PI”) and offline data (what we refer to above as “non-cookie PI”). Below we explain the scenarios in which we apply the Do Not Sell/Share/Target requests communicated by GPC signals to cookie PI and, where applicable, to non-cookie PI:
• When you are visiting our website on a particular internet browser (“browser 1”), we will apply the GPC signal and corresponding Do Not Sell/Share/Target to cookie PI collected on that browser 1.
• When you log in on browser 1: We will be able to apply the GPC signal and corresponding Do Not Sell/Share/Target request to non-cookie PI associated with your user account, but only if and after you have logged into your user account on browser 1.
When you visit our website on a different browser (“browser 2""). If you later visit our website on browser 2 (whether on the same device or a different device) and GPC is not enabled, we are unable to apply the prior GPC signal from browser 1 to cookie PI on browser 2, unless and until you login to your user account on browser 2. We will continue to apply the Do Not Sell/Share/Target opt-outs communicated via the GPC signal on browser 1.
We process GPC signals in a frictionless manner, which means that we do not: (1) charge a fee for use of our service if you have enabled GPC; (2) change your experience with our website if you use GPC; or (3) display a notification, pop-up, text, graphic, animation, sound, video, or any interstitial in response to the GPC.
Incentive and Loyalty Programs; Right to Non-Discrimination
Loyalty/Incentive Programs Notice
We also collect and use your personal data to administer and maintain Rewards Programs (defined above in “
How We Gather & Use Personal Data
”), which may be considered a “financial incentive” or a “bona fide loyalty program” under one or more of the U.S. Privacy Laws.
We use all categories of personal data disclosed in the above table, excluding “biometric information,” “professional or employment information, and “non-public education records,” to administer and maintain such Rewards Programs. All categories of personal data we use for loyalty programs may also be Sold or processed for Targeted Advertising. We may also use, Sell, and process for Targeted Advertising the categories of sensitive personal data or special category data: account information and credentials, precise geolocation data, racial or ethnic origin, and personal data concerning health. While we may collect sensitive personal data or special category data in relation to some Rewards Programs, the collection and processing of sensitive personal data or special category data is not required to participate in Rewards Programs. We use personal data to verify your identity, offer unique rewards, track your program status, and to facilitate the exchange of program points for products, promotional materials, training workshops, and other items. The categories of third parties that will receive personal data and sensitive personal data or special category data are set forth in the table above, some of which may qualify as data brokers under some of the U.S. Privacy Laws. Some U.S. Privacy Laws require us to state whether we provide Rewards Programs benefits through third-party partners; however, while we sometimes will provide you the opportunity to independently engage with third parties through our websites or apps, third parties do not provide Rewards Programs on our behalf.
You can opt-in to a Rewards Program by signing up on the applicable rewards page. If you opt-in to participate in any of our Rewards Programs, you may withdraw from participation at any time by contacting us using the contact details in this Privacy Policy or in accordance with the instructions set forth in the applicable Rewards Program’s terms and conditions.
Under certain U.S. Privacy Laws, you may be entitled to be informed as to why financial incentive programs, or price or service differences, are permitted under the law, including (i) a good-faith estimate of the value of your personal data that forms the basis for offering the financial incentive or price or service difference, and (ii) a description of the method we used to calculate the value of your personal data. Generally, we do not assign monetary or other value to personal data. However, in the event we are required by law to assign such value in the context of Rewards Programs, or price or service differences, we have valued the personal data collected and used as being equal to the value of the discount or benefit provided, and the calculation of the value is based upon a practical and good-faith effort often involving the (i) categories of personal data collected (e.g., names, email addresses), (ii) the use of such personal data for our marketing and business purposes in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our Rewards Programs, (iii) the discounted price offered (if any), (iv) the volume of consumers enrolled in our Rewards Programs, and (v) the product or service to which the Rewards Programs, or price or service differences, applies. The disclosure of the value described herein is not intended to waive, nor should be interpreted as a waiver to, our proprietary or business confidential information, including trade secrets, and does not constitute any representation with regard to generally accepted accounting principles or financial accounting standards. We deem the value of the personal data to be reasonably related to the value of the rewards, and by subscribing to these Rewards Programs you indicate you agree. If you do not, do not subscribe to the Rewards Programs.
Non-Discrimination
You have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment for the exercise of your privacy rights described in this U.S. State Privacy Notice. We will not deny, charge different prices for, or provide a different level or quality of goods or services in a manner that is prohibited by the U.S. Privacy Laws if you choose to exercise your rights. Please note, however, that you will no longer be able to participate in Rewards Programs request to delete personal data. This is because we need the personal data collected in relation Rewards Program to carry out the functions described above.

Thinning hair from stress & medical problems. I’m in my mid-forties and my hair was falling out over the summer in a scary way. I tried the oil and my hair bounced back. I thought because of my age my hair was finished growing. My hair has grown to mid back length from being chin length in over nine months. My hair part is thinner and not wide anymore. I don’t shed huge clumps of hair bigger than my fist. That has stopped completely. This product saved the edges too. Every time I became sick with Covid or the flu, a small patch of hair would fall out in my hairline. Since using this oil combined with the Avocado line, my hair is growing out in a much healthier way. I’ve been able to thermally straighten my hair as of recently. My hair has gone thru so many phases and this company has helped me get thru all of the changes. I Love Mielle! For reference, I am 40+, mixed hair, 3b-3c-4a curl pattern.
Yes, I recommend this product.

LOVE THIS OIL : )
a month ago
I first began using Mielle Organics Rosemary Mint shampoo & conditioner in 2024. However, the winner for me in the collection is this little bottle of Rosemary & Mint Strengthening Oil : ) It has done wonders for my scalp and hair. I saw a decrease in dandruff and my hair looks healthier than ever. I also love that this product consists of various essential oils that is proven to be natural and effective in my hair growth. Sometimes, I use drops of it as a hot oil treatment for deep conditioning after I shampoo. A little goes a long way - but no question about it, this is a MUST-HAVE in my daily beauty regime.
Yes, I recommend this product.

I love this scalp oil. Great if you have a dry itchy scalp. A little goes a long way with this. I only applied to my scalp once per week. And then followed my normal hair care routine. I would recommend this product

I bought my first bottle of this last June and loved it. When I ran out, my local store was out so I bought a different brand thinking what difference will it make? Haha! Jokes on me! That other brand was AWFUL!!! I am very sensitive to smells and that one triggered migraines and caused HAIR LOSS!!!! I will NEVER switch from Mielle again. I use the rosemary shampoo and conditioner as well and was just looking at the other products in that line. Thanks for having my back where my hair care is concerned.

Great Leave In Conditioner For Low Porosity Course And/Or Dry Hair
7 months ago
I don’t do a ton of product reviews but when I find a really great product I try to share. I’ve been using this for several weeks now. This leave in conditioner is really great. It’s very nourishing without leaving a lot of residue and isn’t very expensive. It’s sulfate and formaldehyde/formaldehyde donor free (which is surprising at how well it functions without that). I think it would work well for coarse, dry, curly, or coils as a great part of hair routine. For reference my natural hair is a mixed texture, coarse/dry, low porosity with natural waves, prone to frizz and buildup. (Note, if you have low porosity hair it will take about an hour to soak in without residue but you can continue with your hair routine/styling with no problem and it’s well worth the patience). Target is one store that sells it and I’ll post a product link here too. Enjoy!
Yes, I recommend this product.

GAME CHANGER! *Mint Almond Oil*
9 months ago
I am amazed of how this oil has made my hair so soft!!! I am currently eight months pregnant and with all the hormonal changes of the third trimester, my hair was very dry from mid length all the way to my ends! I thought I needed a trim on my hair and I got a hair cut but my hair continued to feel dry. I got this oil as a gift from a purchase I made and decided to try it. IT IS A GAME CHANGER! I have only used it twice and my hair is so soft!!! My ends do not feel brittle or dry. I am so happy my hair doesn't feel dry anymore. *I have 3B/3C curls*
Yes, I recommend this product.
