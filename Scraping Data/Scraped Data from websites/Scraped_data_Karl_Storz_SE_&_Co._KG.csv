New interactive display technology from KARL STORZ allows collaboration to happen seamlessly inside and outside of the operating room wherever clinical personnel or data resources are located.

KARL STORZ Service
KARL STORZ Service
Full Service from a Single Source
For more than 75 years, the KARL STORZ name has been synonymous with superior visualization technology and surgical instrumentation. By choosing KARL STORZ as a service provider, you will continue to have unmatched visualization and precision throughout the entire product lifecycle.
Only KARL STORZ’s highly trained and certified service technicians have access to proprietary parts and technology, guaranteeing the highest quality repaired or replaced devices while also ensuring compliance with the FDA guidelines for repair, cleaning, and sterilization of medical devices.
Through our service portfolio, we can develop a customized plan that is tailored to protect your equipment investment and address your specific needs.
E-Class® Exchange Program: Elevating the Standard Repair Process
Watch how the E-Class® Exchange program elevates the standard repair process.
Specialist advice
You and your patients deserve endoscopes that meet the same high-quality standards and perform as reliably as brand-new endoscopes after every service. The KARL STORZ E-Class® exchange program was built on that philosophy.
Our E-Class® Exchange program elevates the standard repair process by enabling you to exchange your damaged KARL STORZ products with like-new equipment at repair prices. Our E-Class® exchange endoscopes are built to brand-new endoscope quality standards, so you receive best-in-class optics, illumination, and deflection every time with KARL STORZ service. Replacements are received in as early as 24 hours and come with the latest technology upgrades (within the existing model).
Unlike traditional repair programs, with E-Class® Exchange, you receive:
Little to no downtime with quick turnaround on exchanges 
Maximized efficiency with a hassle-free process and no loaners needed 
Reduced need for a capital equipment repurchase in the near future 
Lowered long-term costs and total cost of ownership 
  KARL STORZ Service Contracts & Programs
Specialist advice
KARL STORZ understands that the total cost of ownership (TCO) for surgical equipment and endoscopes includes a critical service component. To reduce TCO, KARL STORZ offers PROTECTION1® service contracts and programs, which are designed to reduce down time, retain initial equipment quality, and reduce repair costs. KARL STORZ tailors its data-driven service solutions with each healthcare provider to deliver cost savings and performance enhancements, allowing focus to remain on patient care and outcomes.

Specialist advice
Key aspects of controlling and lowering the total cost of ownership of reusable surgical technology are reduction of downtime, retention of initial equipment quality, and the containment of repair costs. To effectively influence these aspects, it is important to ensure that staff members are adequately and regularly trained and educated on critical equipment care topics.

Cleaning and Sterilization is a fundamental component of reusable medical equipment, and therefore, requires a high degree of professional competence and responsibility from all parties involved.

Corporate Insights
KARL STORZ Foundation
KARL STORZ Foundation
The conviction that economic success and social responsibility are not mutually exclusive, but rather intertwined, has always been the ethical foundation for KARL STORZ's corporate endeavors. On this principle, KARL STORZ, as a globally positioned family-owned company, has been supporting medical, humanitarian, scientific, social, and cultural projects around the world for many years. 
With the establishment of the independent Foundation “KARL STORZ Stiftung” by Dr. h. c. mult. Sybill Storz, daughter of the company founder, Dr. med. h. c. Karl Storz, and her son, Karl-Christian Storz, charitable activities are to be further developed, structurally and organizationally bundled, and legally separated from the KARL STORZ company. The foundation was established under civil law in October 2023 and is based in Tuttlingen.
The foundation should promote science, research and education and training, along with general innovations in the field of medical technology. One focus will be the promotion of patient-friendly, minimally invasive treatment methods, the advancement of knowledge about these methods and their practical application, and further development.
Furthermore, the foundation seeks to provide support for medical aid projects, especially in less developed countries and regions, aimed at improving local healthcare systems. The foundation also intends to support humanitarian and social projects, including those related to family, women’s empowerment, youth, education, culture, and sports. The support will be focused on the Tuttlingen region, where the roots of the globally successful company are located. The foundation also operates the TUTORAMA Museum for children in Tuttlingen, opened in July 2023, to foster young people’s interest in the STEM field and inspire passion for science and technology within the local community.
Purpose of the foundation
The Foundation is currently in the detailed development phase and aims to engage with particular focus on the following areas:
Public health system and health care
Science and research in medical and life sciences, medical technology, physics, engineering, and related disciplines
Youth and elderly welfare
Art and culture
Education, public and vocational training
Nature conservation and environmental protection
Development cooperation
Promotion of family
Sports
Foundation Organs
The organs of the Foundation are the Board of Directors and the Foundation Council.
  Board of Directors
The Board of Directors comprises a minimum of two and a maximum of three members. The members of the initial Board of Directors are appointed by the founders. Subsequent members of the Board of Directors are appointed by the Foundation Council. Board members serve for a term of three years, with the possibility of reappointment. The Board of Directors is responsible for managing the Foundation's affairs. This includes the proper administration of assets and the utilization of funds in accordance with the articles of association and applicable laws. Its duties include all affairs of the foundation. 
The members of the Board of Directors are: Dr. h.c. mult. Sybill Storz (Chair) and Stefan Ort
  Foundation Council
The Foundation Council comprises two to five members who are appointed for a period of three years. The members of the initial Foundation Council are appointed by the founders. If a member of the Foundation Council resigns, the successor is elected immediately by the remaining members of the Foundation Council (co-optation). The Foundation Council's role is to advise and oversee the Board of Directors.
The members of the Foundation Council are: Karl-Christian Storz (Chair) and Ortwin Guhl

Miniature Laparoscopy – For animals less than 10 kg  (PDF | 1.1 MB)
Specialist advice
With the dramatic increase in the ownership of rabbits, guinea pigs, chinchillas, rats and hamsters comes the demand for the highest quality of veterinary care.
As these pets benefit from improved preventive medical care and husbandry, their lifespans increase. As a result, the incidence of oral cavity disease, particularly dental disease, increases.
Fish

Endoscopy in Small Exotic Animals – Set for birds, reptiles, amphibians, small mammals and fish  (PDF | 1.0 MB)
Miniature Laparoscopy – For animals less than 10 kg  (PDF | 1.1 MB)
Specialist advice
The increasing popularity of aquariums all over the world presents challenges to more and more veterinarians in this field.
In many cases, celioscopy of fishes is the easiest way to reach a definitive diagnosis in these difficult species.
Indications:
collection of diagnostic specimens such as organ biopsies, brush cytology, and microbiologic specimens
therapeutic procedures, such as parasite removal
identification of sex and reproductive status
VITOM® 25
Specialist advice
Exoscope for open surgery
The VITOM® 25 exoscope offers a revolutionary new way of displaying open surgical procedures in an ergonomic and high quality manner. Unlike a traditional endoscope, the VITOM® 25 is an “exoscope” which is placed at a distance of 25 to 75 cm from the surgical site, held securely in place by a holding device, giving the surgeon ample workspace.
The magnified image produced by the VITOM® 25 is viewed on a video monitor. This enables the surgeon and support staff to work together comfortably, significantly reducing surgeon fatigue, while the magnification of structures improves surgical precision and accuracy of diagnosis.

Multi-Purpose Rigid Telescope For The Small Animal Practice  (PDF | 1.1 MB)
Otoscopes for Small Animals  (PDF | 0.9 MB)
Specialist advice
Diagnostic otoscopy in veterinary medicine is one of the most important applications of endoscopes. Disorders of the external ear are common in dogs; the easy access an superior visualization afforded by this technique make otoendoscopy an ideal method of examination.
A rigid endoscope allows examination of the mitddle ear as well. KARL STORZ now offers a new veterinary otoscopy set consisting of an otoscope with 0° forward-view optic and a 3-way stopcock.
The shape and adapted length make it possible to carry out thorough examinations even in breeds of dogs with long aural passages. The instrument can also be used for treatment: flushing the ear canal, suction, removal of foreign bodies, myringotomy, etc.
Video Otoscopy provides a precise means of assessment of treatment and follow-up, and documentation of findings. The otoscopy set can also be used for oral and dental examination. For anesthetized patients, the Multi-Purpose Rigid Telescope can also be used.
For further information, click on ""Multi-Purpose Rigid Telescope"".
Rhinoscopy
The multipurpose rigid endoscope for the small animal practitioner
Small diameter, extended length fiberscopes for small animals  (PDF | 0.9 MB)
Multi-Purpose Rigid Telescope For The Small Animal Practice  (PDF | 1.1 MB)
Specialist advice
Rhinoscopy may be indicated in dogs and cats with nasal discharge, nasal obstruction, chronic sneezing, epistaxis, facial distortion, nasal pain, acute severe sneezing, reverse sneezing and abnormal radiographs. Both rigid and flexible endoscopes may be used for rhinoscopy.
Rigid lens systems, such as the Multi-Purpose Rigid Telescope offer the best optics, while flexible endoscopes with tip deflection permit post-rhinoscopy (visualization of the posterior nasal cavity by passing the insertion tube orally into the nasopharynx).
For rigid telescopes, we offer sheaths with working channels and flexible instruments for taking biopsies and removing foreign bodies. All sheaths have stopcocks for flushing or suction.
For the complete list of the instruments see ""Multi-Purpose Rigid™ Telescope"".
  Bronchoscopy
Small diameter, extended length fiberscopes for small animals  (PDF | 0.9 MB)
Specialist advice
Bronchoscopy and tracheoscopy may be indicated in certain cases of bronchitis, coughing, pulmonary neoplasia, tracheal collapse, stridor and other abnormal breathing patterns. Both rigid and flexible endoscopes may be used.
Flexible endoscopes typically used for tracheobronchoscopy are available with 5.2 mm, 3.7 mm and 3.0 mm outer diameter.
Rigid bronchoscopes are available with a diameter of 2.9 mm and working length of 36 cm for cats and small dogs and with a diameter of 5.5 mm and working length of 54 cm for larger dogs.
  Arthroscopy
Specialist advice
Arthroscopy is rapidly gaining popularity among veterinary surgeons for both diagnosis and surgery in dogs with chronic lamness, joint pain, joint instability, swelling, crepitus and abnormal radiographic findings, including OCD, DJD and fragmented corinoids.
Telescopes ranging from 1.9 mm to 2.7 mm diameter are used in small animal arthroscopy. The most popular telescope, due to its versatility, is the 2.7 mm Multi-Purpose Rigid™ Telescope.

LAPspay® Systems for Dogs and Cats – Laparoscopic Ovariectomy / Ovariohysterectomy – Single and Multi-Port  (PDF | 0.9 MB)
Specialist advice
The most common indication for laparoscopy in the dog today is biopsy of the liver, kidney, pancreas or masses. Other diagnostic applications include evaluation of abdominal trauma, response to therapy, or abnormal radiographic findings. Laparoscopic surgery is also being performed currently, including ovariectomy, gastropexy, hernia repair and others.
The most common small animal laparoscope has a diameter of 5 mm. However, almost any size rigid telescope may be used for small animal laparoscopy, including the 2.7 mm Multi-Purpose Rigid™ Telescope and standard human laparoscopes, which are 10 mm in diameter. The same instrumentation can be used for thoracoscopy. Indications may include pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, mediastinal disease, abnormal radiographic findings, biopsies and others.
  Cystoscopy
The multipurpose rigid endoscope for the small animal practitioner
Small diameter, extended length fiberscopes for small animals  (PDF | 0.9 MB)
Multi-Purpose Rigid Telescope For The Small Animal Practice  (PDF | 1.1 MB)
Specialist advice
Urethrocystoscopy is indicated in a large number of small animal patients, including those presenting with chronic cystitis, pollakuria, hematuria, stranguria, incontinence, trauma, calculi and abnormal radiographs. Performing urethrocystoscopy in the variety of patients we see in small animal practice requires more than one endoscope. The most popular small animal cystoscope is the Multi-Purpose Rigid Telescope which is ideal for female dogs ranging from approximately 5-45 lbs .
For further Information click on Multi-Purpose Rigid Telescope.
Use of this telescope for cystoscopy in males requires either a perineal urethroscopy or the transabdominal approach. The transabdominal approach may also be indicated in females where urethral diameter is too small. Smaller rigid telescopes are available with HOPKINS® optics, diameter 1.9 mm.
The ideal endoscope for transurethral cystoscopy in male dogs is the Specialty Fiberscope with 3.0 mm diameter and extended length of 1 m. For larger female dogs, an extended length telescope with sheath diameter of 17 Fr. and 29 cm working length is used.
Gastroscopy
Specialist advice
Upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopy is perhaps the most widely indicated application of endoscopy in small animals. A partial list of indications includes regurgitation, dysphagia, salivation, nausea, vomiting, hematemesis, melena, anorexia, diarrhea, weight loss, hematochezia, fecal mucus and tenesmus.
Our new SILVER SCOPE® Veterinary Videoendoscopes with extended lengths, fine diameters and large biopsy channels are extremely versatile for applications in veterinary medicine.
Unifying state-of-the art technology, ergonomics and durability, our SILVER SCOPE® videoendoscopes consistently deliver images with unsurpassed clarity, brightness and depth of field. The new ergonomic design ensures an easy, comfortable grip to reduce fatigue. SILVER SCOPE® videoendoscopes incorporate the latest design innovations to reduce scope damage, minimizing downtime and reducing repair costs.
  Vaginoscopy, Insemination
Veterinary Endoscope for Insemination & Hysteroscpoy  (PDF | 1.3 MB)
Multi-Purpose Rigid Telescope For The Small Animal Practice  (PDF | 1.1 MB)
Specialist advice
Indications for vaginoscopy and colposcopy (endoscopy of the cervix) include vaginal discharge, bleeding, masses, trauma, incontinence, foreign body removal and stranguria as well as artificial insemination.
The 2.7 mm ""Multi-Purpose Rigid™ Telescope"" is ideal for many of these procedures. In order to reach the cranial pole of the bladder in larger bitches, and for artificial insemination or hysteroscopy, an extended length HOPKINS telescope is recommended.
  VITOM® 25
Specialist advice
Exoscope for open surgery
The VITOM® 25 exoscope offers a revolutionary new way of displaying open surgical procedures in an ergonomic and high quality manner. Unlike a traditional endoscope, the VITOM® 25 is an “exoscope” which is placed at a distance of 25 to 75 cm from the surgical site, held securely in place by a holding device, giving the surgeon ample workspace.
The magnified image produced by the VITOM® 25 is viewed on a video monitor. This enables the surgeon and support staff to work together comfortably, significantly reducing surgeon fatigue, while the magnification of structures improves surgical precision and accuracy of diagnosis.

(PDF | 1.5 MB)
“The BIVASCULAR VET vastly reduces the time taken to perform a laparoscopic ovariectomy. It is simple to use, trustworthy, and does not require complex parts to be put together. The feedback mechanism provides peace of mind before cutting tissue, and the inbuilt blade makes the procedure much faster. It connects swiftly to the AUTOCON® III VET , and the AUTOCON® is a very user-friendly system. I would recommend!” 
Becky Keeble 
BVM&S MRCVS 
Director Simply Keyhole  
“The BIVASCULAR VET unit is a user friendly instrument with a built in blade. Allowing 360 degree jaw rotation it makes it particularly handy for accurate laparoscopic dissection. It is light weight and helps prevent fatigue during longer procedures. Connection to the AUTOCON® III VET unit is easy and the feedback signal particularly useful for beginner laparoscopists performing ovariectomies and ovariohysterectomies. “

Quality Management
KARL STORZ has put in place a certified quality management system in accordance with the standards DIN EN ISO 9001:2015 and DIN EN ISO 13485:2016. In addition, the system meets the requirements of the European Medical Devices Directive 93/42/EEC Annex II and additional national regulations and legal requirements, such as the Canadian Medical Device Regulation, the Japanese Pharmaceutical Affairs Law, and the QSR of the US FDA.
KARL STORZ is particularly committed to the safety of our instruments and devices. Testing product quality is therefore an essential part of our quality assurance measures. For this reason, we exclusively use components with proven reliability and safety. In close collaboration with accredited inspection offices, we perform detailed testing and obtain product certifications. The manufacturing and testing processes of our instruments and devices are reliable, efficient, and subject to continuous monitoring.
Each production process is followed by safety testing performed with specially developed testing systems, and the results are individually documented: This means that before delivery, each product leaves its distinctive fingerprint.

Documentation
Documentation Therapeutic strategies can only be efficiently discussed if the diagnoses are objectively documented. The fact that this is now a matter of routine is due to KARL STORZ. Scientific progress would be unthinkable without a rapid, comprehensive flow of information on diagnostic findings.
The KARL STORZ enterprise has developed technologies for making diagnostic results immediately accessible to all parties involved in the treatment process.
KARL STORZ pioneered image-supported documentation of veterinary medical diagnoses initially with the aid of flash devices for 35 mm cameras and, in later years, with high powered video systems for use within the sterile area, and gained valuable experience with these systems.
Digital technology has already replaced many conventional documentation media. With the development of the integrated operating room, digital data archiving and global communication from the operating room, KARL STORZ is now pioneering applications which tomorrow will be a matter of routine.
The range of KARL STORZ products comprises state-of-the-art fully digital 3-Chip-Cameras along with mobile ALL-in-ONE solutions for the medical practice, together with the necessary peripheral devices such as monitors, video recorders and video printers. For the all-important field of illumination, KARL STORZ offers a range of unparalleled diversity that covers the entire spectrum of possible applications – from the high-power xenon light source to the mobile battery light source.

Specialist advice
The IMAGE1 S™ 4U camera system allows the operating surgeon to make optimal use of the benefits offered by 4K technology. A notable feature is the image quality: High image brightness, impressive colors, greater richness of detail and a significantly improved depth effect characterize this system. Thanks to the system’s modularity, 4U components can be easily integrated into the existing IMAGE1 S™ camera platform. Consequently, the system is still compatible with existing technologies (e.g., rigid, flexible, fluorescence and 3D endoscopy) and can be adapted to meet individual customer needs.
IMAGE1 S™ 4U impresses with outstanding, razor-sharp images
Excellent image brightness
First-rate color rendition
Greater richness of detail
Three innovative visualization technologies for tissue differentiation:
CLARA: Homogeneous illumination
CHROMA: Contrast enhancement
SPECTRA*: Spectral color shift and switch
Easy integration into the IMAGE1 S™ camera platform

VITOM® 25
Specialist advice
Exoscope for open surgery
The VITOM® 25 exoscope offers a revolutionary new way of displaying open surgical procedures in an ergonomic and high quality manner. Unlike a traditional endoscope, the VITOM® 25 is an “exoscope” which is placed at a distance of 25 to 75 cm from the surgical site, held securely in place by a holding device, giving the surgeon ample workspace.
The magnified image produced by the VITOM® 25 is viewed on a video monitor. This enables the surgeon and support staff to work together comfortably, significantly reducing surgeon fatigue, while the magnification of structures improves surgical precision and accuracy of diagnosis.

Laparoscopy, Thoracoscopy
Laparoscopy and Thoracoscopy in Equine Practice  (PDF | 1.2 MB)
Specialist advice
Laparoscopy has become a desirable alternative to many open abdominal surgical procedures in the horse. Laparoscopic procedures have also been recently developed for cattle, perhaps most significantly for the surgical correction of abomasal displacement.
Depending upon the indication, equine laparoscopy can be performed on patients while standing or in dorsal recumbency. CO2 insufflation is required to distend the abdomen in order to visualize organs. Indications for laparoscopy in the horse include visual examination, organ biopsy, acute or chronic colic, cryptorchidectomy, castration, inguinal hernia, ovariectomy, neoplasia and embryo transfer. KARL STORZ has developed specialized instrumentation for these procedures. The basic set is featured in our ENDOWORLD® VET 22.
Equine thoracoscopy is often performed in the standing horse with pleuropneumonia. In a single procedure, biopsies can be taken and adhesions divided. Thoracoscopy can also be performed in lateral recumbency. Another common indication for thoracoscopy in the horse is thoracic neoplasia. The telescopes and instruments used in thoracoscopy are the same as those used for laparoscopy.
Gastroscopy, Bronchoscopy, Hysteroscopy
Large Animal Videoendoscopes  (PDF | 0.8 MB)
Specialist advice
In large animal medicine, flexible endoscopes are a standard component of diagnostic equipment. They are particularly useful for differentiating among disease processes in the upper respiratory tract and gastrointestinal tract.
KARL STORZ´s new video endoscope range sets new standards for image quality. Utilization of the very latest in digital processing technology, high resolution CCD chips, and an enhanced optical system results in endoscopes that produce images with unique clarity.
Further Information
Theloresectoscopy
Rigid Endoscopy in Cattle  (PDF | 1.1 MB)
Specialist advice
The SEEH/HOSPES theloresectoscopy set is used to examine and resect the bovine teat, either via the streak canal or with a lateral, single puncture approach. With either approach, visual examination is easily performed, as well as resection of tissue that occludes the teat canal.
Further Information
Embryo Transfer
Rigid Endoscopy in Cattle  (PDF | 1.1 MB)
Specialist advice
KARL STORZ instruments are available for embryo transfer in cattle, horses, sheep and goats. The embryo transfer instrument set makes it possible to place the embryo precisely in the uterine horn under visual control.
Further Information
Laparoscopic abomasal repositioning
Rigid Endoscopy in Cattle  (PDF | 1.1 MB)
Specialist advice
The increasing number of left abomasal displacements in high-producing cows requires the use of new technologies. Endoscopic techniques reduce treatment times, are more gentle on patients, and hence reduce losses for owners. Laparoscopy additionally facilitates correct toggle placement and combines the advantages of laparotomy (repositioning and fixation under view) with those of the roll-and-suture technique and percutaneous fixation (quick and minimally invasive).
With the animal in a standing position, the laparoscope is placed in the left flank. This positioning ensures a clear view of the displaced abomasum. Under endoscopic guidance, the trocar for toggle placement is inserted into the abomasum. The toggle is fixed in place in the abomasum through the trocar. The procedure can be finished in dorsal recumbency with caudolateral trocar placement, or the instrument for toggle placement can be used with the animal in a standing position. The laparoscope is placed caudolaterally to the sternum, and through a second trocar located caudally to the first, the toggle suture is grasped using a grasping forceps and then tied there. The suture can be cut after 3-4 weeks.
The KARL STORZ abomasopexy set combines an excellent optical system with high quality instruments and toggle. The toggle features 2 suture holes with special rounding to prevent premature suture rupture in the abomasum.
VITOM® 25
Specialist advice
Exoscope for open surgery
The VITOM® 25 exoscope offers a revolutionary new way of displaying open surgical procedures in an ergonomic and high quality manner. Unlike a traditional endoscope, the VITOM® 25 is an “exoscope” which is placed at a distance of 25 to 75 cm from the surgical site, held securely in place by a holding device, giving the surgeon ample workspace.
The magnified image produced by the VITOM® 25 is viewed on a video monitor. This enables the surgeon and support staff to work together comfortably, significantly reducing surgeon fatigue, while the magnification of structures improves surgical precision and accuracy of diagnosis.

2. Third parties and international transfers
Recipients within the KARL STORZ Group
Your personal data may be received by different recipients within the KARL STORZ Group. Depending on the categories of personal data and the purposes for which the personal data has been collected, different KARL STORZ entities and the internal departments within the KARL STORZ entities may receive your personal data. For example, our IT department may have access to your account data, and our marketing and sales departments may have access to your account data or data relating to product orders. Moreover, other departments within the KARL STORZ Group may have access to certain personal data about you on a need to know basis, such as the legal department, the finance department or internal auditing.
Transfer to service providers
We may engage external and internal service providers, who act as our data processor in order to provide certain services to us, such as website service providers, order fulfilment providers, customer care providers, marketing service providers, IT support service providers, and other service providers who support us in maintaining our commercial relationship with you in any other way. When providing such services, the external service or internal providers may have access to and/or may process your personal data. We require those service providers to implement and apply security safeguards to ensure the privacy and security of your personal data.
Other recipients
We may transfer - in compliance with applicable data protection law - personal data to law enforcement agencies, governmental authorities, judicial authorities, legal counsel, external consultants, or business partners. In case of a corporate merger or acquisition, personal data may be transferred to the third parties involved in the merger or acquisition. We will not disclose your personal data to third parties for advertising or marketing purposes or for any other purposes without permission.
International transfers of personal data
The personal data that we collect or receive about you may be transferred to and processed by recipients that are located inside or outside the European Economic Area (""EEA""). For recipients located outside of the EEA, some are located in countries with adequacy decisions (in particular, UK, Argentina, Canada (for non-public organizations subject to the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act) and Switzerland), and, in each case, the transfer is thereby recognized as providing an adequate level of data protection from a European data protection law perspective. Other recipients might be located in countries which do not adduce an adequate level of protection from a European data protection law perspective. We will take all necessary measures to ensure that transfers out of the EEA are adequately protected as required by applicable data protection law. With respect to transfers to countries not providing an adequate level of data protection, we will base the transfer on appropriate safeguards, such as standard data protection clauses adopted by the European Commission or by a supervisory authority, approved codes of conduct together with binding and enforceable commitments of the recipient, or approved certification mechanisms together with binding and enforceable commitments of the recipient. You can ask for a copy of such appropriate safeguards by contacting us as set out in Sec. 6 (Contact us) below.
3. What rights do you have and how can you assert your rights?
If you have declared your consent regarding certain collecting, processing and use of your personal data (in particular regarding the receipt of direct marketing communication via email, SMS/MMS, fax, and telephone), you can withdraw this consent at any time with future effect. Further, you can object to the use of your personal data for the purposes of marketing (free of charge) without incurring any costs other than the transmission costs in accordance with the basic tariffs (see below for further information on the right to object).

Such right to object may especially apply if KARL STORZ collects and processes your personal data for profiling purposes in order to better understand your business interests in KARL STORZ' products and services. Further you may object to the use of your data for direct marketing via personal visits, postal mail or – in case of an ongoing business relationship - email.

The provider of this website uses the services of etracker GmbH, Hamburg, Germany (www.etracker.com) to analyse usage data. We do not use cookies for web analysis by default. If we use analysis and optimisation cookies, we will obtain your explicit consent separately in advance. If this is the case and you agree, cookies are used to enable a statistical range analysis of this website, a measurement of the success of our online marketing measures and test procedures, e.g. to test and optimise different versions of our online offer or its components. Cookies are small text files that are stored by the Internet browser on the user's device. etracker cookies do not contain any information that could identify a user.
The data generated by etracker on behalf of the provider of this website is processed and stored by etracker solely in Germany by commission of the provider of this website and is thus subject to the strict German and European data protection laws and standards. In this regard, etracker was independently checked, certified and awarded with the ePrivacyseal data protection seal of approval.
The data processing is based on Art. 6 Section 1 lit f (legitimate interest) of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

LinkedIn Insight Tag
This website uses LinkedIn Insight Tag, a tracking and analytics tool provided by LinkedIn Ireland Unlimited Company, Wilton Place, Dublin 2, Ireland.
The LinkedIn Insight Tag enables the collection of data about members' visits to our website, including URL, referrer, IP address, device and browser characteristics, timestamp, and page views. The LinkedIn Insight tag is a small JavaScript code snippet that we have added to our website.
LinkedIn does not share the personal data with the website owner, but only provides aggregated reports on the website's audience and ad performance. LinkedIn also offers retargeting for website visitors, enabling the website owner to serve personalized ads on their website using this data without identifying the member. LinkedIn members can control the use of their personal data for advertising purposes in their account settings. To disable the Insight tag on our website (""opt-out"") click here.

LinkedIn members can control the use of their personal data for advertising purposes via their account settings. 
For more information on data protection at LinkedIn, please see LinkedIn's privacy policy.
Google Ads
On our websites we use Google Ads. Google Ads is an online advertising program by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (“Google”). We use on the one hand the remarketing function within the Google Ads service. With the remarketing function, we can present adverts based on their interests to website users on other websites in the Google display network (Google itself, so-called “Google ads”, or on other websites). For this, the user’s interaction on our website is analyzed, e.g. the offers the user is interested in, to be able to show target adverts on other pages after visiting our website. To do so, Google saves a number in the user's browser when they visit certain Google services or websites in the Google display network. This user's visits are recorded via this number, which is referred to as a “Cookie”. This number is used to uniquely identify a web browser on a particular computer and not to identify a person; personal data is not stored. You can deactivate the use of the Cookie by Google by following this link, then downloading and installing the plug-in provided there: https://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin. For more information on Google remarketing and the Google data privacy declaration, see: https://www.google.com/privacy/ads/
We also use so-called conversion tracking as part of the Google Ads service. When you click on an advert placed by Google, a Cookie is stored for conversion tracking on your computer/device. These Cookies become invalid after 30 days, do not contain personal information and are not used for personal identification. The information obtained using the conversion Cookie is used to produce conversion statistics for Google Ads customers who have chosen conversion tracking.
You can prevent the installation of Cookies by adjusting the relevant setting in your browser software; but in this case, we expressly point out that you may not be able to use the full functions of this website. You can also deactivate interest-related adverts on Google and interest-related Google adverts in the web (within the Google display network) in your browser by activating the “Off” button under https://www.google.com/settings/ads or deactivating it at https://www.aboutads.info/choices/. You can find additional information on related options and data privacy at Google under https://policies.google.com/privacy.
  Meta Pixel
Our website uses the Meta Pixel, an analysis tool to measure the effectiveness of our Facebook advertising and to optimize target group-specific data. The Meta Pixel tracks user behavior on our website and links this information with user data on Facebook. Cookies and similar technologies are used for this purpose. The Meta Pixel is used to measure the success and optimize our advertisements via social networks. It enables us to reach better-defined target groups and thus generate higher sales and reach.  
Data processing is carried out on the legal basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR. The data collected is anonymous to us as the website operator. We cannot draw any conclusions about the identity of the user. However, the data is stored and processed by Meta so that a connection with the respective user profile on Facebook is possible and Meta can use the data for its own advertising purposes in accordance with the Meta Data Usage Policy. The Meta Privacy Policy can be found here: Meta Privacy Policy. Meta processes your data, including personal information, in the USA and other countries. As an active participant in the EU-US Data Privacy Framework, Meta ensures the proper and secure transfer of personal data of EU citizens to the US. Further information can be found on the website of the European Commission: Adequacy decision for the EU-US Data Privacy Framework.
Meta also uses so-called standard contractual clauses (= Art. 46 (2) and (3) GDPR). These Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) are provided by the EU Commission. With the EU-US Data Privacy Framework and the Standard Contractual Clauses, Meta undertakes to comply with the European level of data protection when processing your personal data, even if the data is stored, processed and managed in the USA. These clauses are based on an implementing decision of the EU Commission. You can find the decision and the standard contractual clauses here. This allows Meta to place adverts on Facebook pages as well as outside of Facebook. We have no influence on this. Users have the option to object to tracking by Meta Pixel at any time. The objection has no negative consequences. 
  Friendly Captcha (Bot/Spam Protection)
We use the ""Friendly Captcha"" service on our website (www.friendlycaptcha.com).
This service is provided by Friendly Captcha GmbH, Am Anger 3-5, 82237 Woerthsee, Germany.
Friendly Captcha is a new type of privacy-friendly security solution to make it increasingly difficult for automated programs and scripts (so-called ""bots"") to use our website.
For this purpose, we have integrated a program code from Friendly Captcha into our website (e.g. for contact forms) so that the visitor's end device can establish a connection to Friendly Captcha's servers in order to receive a computational task from Friendly Captcha. The visitor's end device solves the computational task, which requires certain system resources, and sends the computational results to our web server. Our server contacts the Friendly Captcha server via an API and receives a response stating whether the puzzle was solved correctly by the end device. Depending on the result, we can apply security rules to requests via our website and thus, for example, further process or reject them.
