Keiichiro Aoki
President of JK Holdings
The JK Holdings Group, with a corporate philosophy of ""Creating a Comfortable & Rich Living Environment"" is engaged in a diverse range of businesses encompassing the housing industry, including building materials wholesaling, manufacturing, retailing, and construction. We always update the lineup of building materials to our customers to make sure they can catch up with the trend of housing needs, and we will supply the newest materials whenever the customer needs them. We also contribute to improving the ""environment"" of the industry by providing management know-how and producing complicated paperwork on behalf of housing companies and dealers. Going forward, we will be even more proactive in addressing various sustainability-related issues to ensure the sustainable growth of the company and create medium- to long-term corporate value. In particular, we intend to focus on promoting ""use of timber in buildings"" which will attract public attention as we work to achieve a carbon neutrality by 2050. We believe that ""use of timber in buildings"" will contribute to the prevention of global warming. While strengthening our business centered on the utilization of forest resources, we will also focus on strengthening cooperation among group companies and promoting diversity to transform what we have into something new and better. We hope you will look forward to the further progress of our group.

Basic Policy for Procuring Wood and
Wooden Products
Purpose and Background
JK Holdings Group considers global environmental issues to be one of its most important management priorities in order to fulfill its corporate philosophy of ""Creating a Comfortable ＆ Rich Living Environment.” And since the JK Holdings Group deal plywood and other wooden building materials as its main products, we believe that we can contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gases and the preservation of biodiversity by building a recycling-oriented society that utilizes forest resources such as wood and wooden building materials. In order to protect natural forests and continue sustainable wood procurement, the Group has established the following as its Basic Policy for Procuring Wood and Wooden products, and will work step by step to implement the policy.
Scope
This basic policy applies to wood, wooden building materials, and wooden boards procured by JK Holdings Group of companies. This basic policy does not apply to products derived from construction waste.
Basic Policy
JK Holdings Group will strive to procure products based on the following policies in order to put our corporate philosophy into practice.
We will promote the procurement of products that have been certified for legality and sustainability, including environmental and social aspects, for the conservation of sustainable forests.
We will strive to conserve forests that have high value conservation.
We will respect the rights of indigenous peoples in the country of origin and strive to offer due consideration to them.
We will respect all the rights of workers in the country of origin and strive to provide necessary actions for their health and safety.
We will promote procurement in compliance with relevant laws and regulations.
Code of Conduct（Implementation and Operation）
We will promote the procurement of woods that have been certified for legality and　sustainability, including environmental and social aspects, positively utilizing the forest certification system, and ensuring traceability for the conservation of sustainable forests.
We will implement the system step by step according to the characteristics of each country and region, periodically review its implementation status, and promote continuous improvement.
We will cooperate with business partners, experts, government agencies, and other stakeholders to promote initiatives.
We regularly monitor the implementation of this policy.

  Forest Certification
In May 2017, JK Holdings Group formulated its Basic Policy for Procuring Wood and Wooden products, and as part of its eforts based on this policy, the Group is working to acquire and promote forest certification system.
Japan Kenzai Co., Ltd., a core company of JK Holdings Group, has acquired Chain of Custody (CoC) certification under FSC® and SGEC/PEFC, and procures and sells forest certified products with easy traceability and high reliability. JK Holdings Group believe that actively promoting and selling environmentally friendly products, including forest certified products, will lead to the protection and maintenance of forests, which in turn will contribute to the preservation of the global environment and biodiversity.
