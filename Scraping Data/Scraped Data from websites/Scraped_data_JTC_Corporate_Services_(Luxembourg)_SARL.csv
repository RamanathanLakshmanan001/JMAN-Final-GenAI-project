What Most People Don’t Realize About 1031 Exchanges
Share:
At a JTC webinar, the panelists explained why success and failure in real estate investing can often come down to who really understands IRC Section 1031 and who doesn’t.
One of the most useful things about IRC Section 1031 is that because it can apply to so many different types of property held for business or investment use, it can be used by just as many different types of taxpayers: farmers, small business owners, commercial real estate companies with multifamily and office portfolios, corporations that own multiple retail sites, individuals with rental or vacation properties, and anyone invested in a Delaware Statutory Trust.
But 1031 is only useful if you know how to use it. To help exchangers better understand the ways in which Section 1031 can be employed, JTC gathered a group of 1031 exchange experts for The Future of 1031: Considering Exchanges Now and Long-Term. At this virtual event, the panelists shared some of the wisdom they’ve gained from years in the industry, including the questions they get asked the most about like-kind exchanges.
Understanding what types of property can be included in an exchange
Property owners who’ve done Internet searches on 1031 probably have a basic understanding that a 1031 exchange must involve “like-kind” properties. But as the panelists explained, people frequently misunderstand what it means for a property to be “like-kind.”
“That’s actually one of the most common questions that we do get,” said JTC National Sales Manager & Account Executive Justin Amos. “As long as it’s investment real estate to investment real estate, or business real estate, it’ll qualify from a 1031 exchange perspective.”
“I would say I answer that question more often than any other,” concurred Head of Specialty Administration & General Counsel USA Jill Jones. “There is misinformation out there where someone feels like, ‘if I sell a rental home, I have to buy another rental home.’
“Like-kind property is any kind of property that you’re holding for business or investment purposes,” she explained. “So you could go from a commercial building to a portfolio of rental homes. You could go into vacant land. It could be farmland. Again, any kind of real estate that’s held for business or investment purposes will qualify. You don’t have to match them exact for exact.”
“A lot of the times people do ask whether they can sell their single-family property for multifamily apartments or vacant land, which they absolutely can, and vice versa,” said JTC’s Nicole Walker, who went over what is not exchangeable, including personal property like a primary residence, personal-use vacation homes, aircraft, artwork, stocks, bonds, etc.
“Limited partnership or LLC interests, that is a big catch for people in 1031,” said Jones. Even though a multi-member LLC may exist solely to own property, it’s the LLC that owns that property; the individual partners own interests in the LLC, and those interests are not exchangeable.
“Look at how the property is held,” said Jones. “Is it held by a partnership or an LLC that has multiple members? If so, underneath that, the individuals don’t own the real property. Technically, they own an interest in that entity. And so steps need to be taken to either correct that prior to starting the exchange, or just to know that that wouldn’t be an exchangeable interest.”
“Multi-member LLC interests or partnership interests, those simply cannot be exchanged,” said Steve Ghirardo, Principal, Ghirardo CPA. “It doesn’t mean that it’s impossible to defer gain out of those situations where you have a multi-ownership LLC or partnership,” he added, with a word of caution: “There are ways to do it, but they take some time, and you gotta be careful.”
To go from a multi-member LLC to another ownership structure like a tenancy in common that allows for individual exchanges requires a process called a drop & swap. But as Amos noted, these transactions involve careful planning and proper documentation, especially if you live in a state where they’re seen as a red flag.
“If you’re a California real estate owner, the franchise board does not like those, especially closer to the sale,” he said. “Advanced tax planning is always preferable in any type of transaction, but specifically with the drop and swap.”
The many types of 1031 exchanges that are available
The panelists walked attendees through a few often-overlooked scenarios where Section 1031 can be employed. One of those situations is an exchange involving property located outside the United States, which is allowed so long as both the relinquished and replacement properties are located outside the U.S.
“We’ve been doing a lot more foreign exchanges,” said Walker. “There’s been definitely an uptick in those recently.” Because of the complications of various jurisdictions and tax regimes abroad, foreign-property exchanges require a certain type of global presence and experience to execute, which has made JTC a popular Qualified Intermediary (QI) to help with those kinds of transactions.
Another frequently-misunderstood type of exchange is the improvement exchange, where some of the sales proceeds are used to make improvements to the replacement property during the exchange period. This includes not just basic maintenance and upgrades, but potentially the construction of entirely new structures.
As Walker explained at the webinar, this provides flexibility because the exchanger doesn’t have to find a property valued at or above the one they’re selling. They could instead find a lower-valued property and use some of the sales proceeds for construction and upgrades, thereby utilizing their entire sales proceeds and achieving full tax deferral.
“It does need to be completed within that 180-day period, and the invoices have to be paid for completed invoices,” cautioned Walker. “So you want to make sure that your contractor is providing you with the correct information and that they’ve completed the work that they’re invoicing you for.”
An improvement exchange can be risky if the exchanger doesn’t think the work will be finished by the end of the exchange period. Pre-paying for labor or materials doesn’t count, so if you want to defer taxes on the full sales proceeds from the relinquished property sale, your construction must be completed by the deadline. If not, she said, “you can only utilize what part is actually completed.”
“You will get the deferral on the amount that is done,” added Jones. But for exchangers looking to defer capital gains taxes on their entire relinquished property value, the improvement exchange must be planned carefully in advance.
JTC’s exchange experts often get asked about vacation homes. Personal-use vacation homes are considered personal property, but those rented out through sites like Airbnb are valid business properties. So what about if you rent out your vacation home some of the year and use it yourself for other parts of the year? There are strict guidelines that must be followed.
“You can only use it for personal use either for 10% of the time that it has been rented or up to two weeks of the year,” said Walker, “so there are limitations on that piece.”
“If you do have a situation where you have a vacation rental and you’re using it part of the time for personal use, the number-one important thing for you to do is document, document, document,” said Jones. “How often were you there? Can you show marketing materials for when it was available for rent? The more evidence you have to support that your personal use was minimal and below the thresholds that Nicole pointed out, the better off you’ll be.”
Ghirardo recommended keeping personal use to a minimum in the two years leading up to when the property is to be sold.
“If you can limit your personal use for that time, while renting it out to others, then you meet the safe harbor provision to have that property qualify as 1031 and for full tax deferral, even though you may have used it personally a lot over the years preceding that two-year period,” he said.
Documenting personal and business use is also crucial for those hoping to combine a 1031 exchange with the Section 121 exclusion for a primary residence, which is possible for those who live on one part of the property and rent out another, or those who operate businesses out of the home.
“People forget their home-based businesses,” said Amos. “That may not be a huge chunk of their primary residence, but that does qualify.”
Ghirardo explained that for those with home-based businesses, it’s crucial to look back at previous tax returns to see how the property has been divided up between personal and business use.
“For example, farmers,” said Jones. “There’s a part of the property that is a homestead, where the house is, and there’s a part of the property that is for business and investment use. And so you can carve those apart separately to have the tax advantages for the homestead under Section 121, and for the business-use property under 1031.”
Like with other complex exchanges, the panelists stressed the importance of documentation, and of understanding the rules before starting the exchange. Getting competent tax and legal advice is a must in order to be sure your exchange will qualify.
The importance of a knowledgeable Qualified Intermediary
In terms of advice, the panelists were quick to point out that it helps to get started early.
“One of the things I love to touch on,” said Amos, “is Day Zero, and the amount of legwork you can do ahead of time, prior to the sale of the relinquished property.”
“The sooner you start, the better,” said Walker, who agreed she would “definitely encourage people to reach out, get their information, kind of try to get everything settled as soon as possible.”
“One of the mistakes I’ll see exchangers make, is they won’t let their real estate agent know,” said Ghirardo. As we’ve noted in the past, you can’t just sell a property and then decide to do an exchange. Speaking with your team and getting all documentation in order is crucial from the very beginning.
“Enlist the services of a Qualified Intermediary, first and foremost, before you do your sale,” said Walker. “That is very important. A lot of people ask that question, if they’ve done it after they’ve closed, and the answer is, no, you do have to enlist it and engage us before you do your sale. In the agreements, you should have a cooperation clause saying that the buyer and seller will cooperate, that this is part of the 1031 exchange, for both the relinquished and the replacement property.”
Amos stressed that when looking for a QI, you shouldn’t just find whichever one is the cheapest. Especially in the types of lesser-known scenarios talked about at the webinar, he said, you need a QI that can “guide you on how to pursue the type of transaction that would best fit your tax situation.”
That’s what makes JTC different from other QIs out there. We have a team with decades of experience across many thousands of transactions, including specialized expertise in reverse exchanges, improvement exchanges, and other complex scenarios. Whether you’re working with a Delaware Statutory Trust that’s involved in hundreds of exchanges per year, or you’re a farmer looking to move to a new plot of land, JTC can provide you with the same level of expertise, personalized service, and institutional-grade security to help your exchange succeed.
The panel also discussed permissible exchange expenses, tax straddling, how long you should hold a property before performing a 1031 exchange, how recent events like the California wildfires affect 1031 exchanges, and plenty more. Check out the webinar to learn how understanding the rules of 1031 could be the key to a successful investing strategy.

Meet the Team
Sustainability and Impact Services
Our services span advisory, regulatory compliance, outsourced reporting and our virtual Chief Sustainability Officer (vCSO) offering. These services are supported by market-leading technology, and we are proud to partner with Novata as our preferred tech-enabled reporting platform. At JTC, we believe that responsible business practices help to create long-term value. Our sustainability and impact services are designed to support your business in assessing, adopting and integrating a wide range of sustainability principles effectively. Whether you need guidance on regulatory frameworks, implementation of sustainability goals, or support with governance structures, our global team combines deep expertise with practical strategies tailored to your objectives. Let us help you confidently achieve your sustainability ambitions.
Advisory
Our experts in the UK, Europe and the US are able to provide a wide range of advisory services, including Health Checks, gap analysis and ‘proof of capture’ relating to sustainability regulations.
Regulatory Compliance
We can help you navigate the rapidly evolving and increasingly complex sustainability regulatory environment, helping to ensure that your organisation is compliant at all times. We specialise in SFDR, UK SDR, CSRD and TCFD among others.
Outsourced Reporting
The complexity of data collection and processing, including the use of specialist software to enable accurate, efficient and timely reporting sits at the heart of our outsourced reporting service. We have expertise in a wide variety of voluntary and mandatory frameworks and Outsourced Reporting is often a natural extension to our Regulatory Compliance service, allowing clients to focus on their core activities while we take care of the reporting burden.

The growing complexities of sustainability regulation and reporting require both technology and human expertise which is why I’m happy to be announcing our partnership with JTC to offer market-leading solutions that encompass both sustainability technology and advisory services to JTC’s clients around the world.
Conor O’Laoire, Head of Partnerships at Novata
“
We would like to thank JTC, for working with us to assess and offset our carbon footprint. They were pro-active in managing this project for us, ascertaining the carbon footprint of our organisation over three offices globally, arranging the audit of the results, and helping us achieve the necessary carbon offset.
Alternative Investment Managers Association (AIMA)
“
We were recommended JTC’s ESG team through our industry network whilst selecting an independent ESG readiness review provider. They were the clear stand out from several firms. They were efficient, knowledgeable and quick during the diligence process, and were swift to provide feedback following the review itself. We would not hesitate to recommend their services and plan to use them again for further assessment work later this year.
Sandbar Asset Management, CEO
“
As an industry, we have pledged to take action to mitigate climate change risk through sustainable finance. To provide true leadership, we must also work to embed sustainability in our own operations and everyday lives. This means measuring our impact and taking action to reduce or offset our carbon footprint. These small actions add up and we are proud to work with JTC and other innovators across our network to support change towards a more sustainable environment.
Irish Funds, CEO
“
We would like to thank JTC Group, and especially their ESG Services team for working with us to complete the carbon emissions assessment and offset our carbon footprint. They were pro-active in managing this project for us from inception to carbon neutral certification. They helped us with the detail questions and follow-up with our suppliers, took us through the carbon footprint calculations for our organisation, arranged the audit of the results and introduced us to carbon offset options. We would also add that the ESG team exuded a passion for their service, they were keen to help and helped us appreciate a bigger picture even for our own small ESG project. We would certainly recommend their service.
Mainspring, COO

Building a Culture of Shared Ownership Together
At JTC, Shared Ownership is at the core of who we are. It drives success, fosters collaboration, and ensures that everyone in our company has a stake in the future we build together.
Shared Ownership means every employee at JTC is an owner, invested in the success of the business. This model aligns our goals, encourages accountability, and enables us to deliver exceptional results for our clients while fostering a fulfilling and prosperous environment for all team members.
What Shared Ownership Means
for Everyone at JTC
Being an owner of JTC means more than just holding shares in a company. It’s about being empowered to make impactful decisions, contribute to growth, and share in the rewards of success – shaping not only the company’s future but also your own professional journey.
Think like an owner
We take responsibility, think long-term, and act in the best interests of our clients and colleagues.
Act like an owner
Empowered to make a difference, we take action that positively impacts JTC, our clients, and the community.
Rewarded as an owner
Contributions are recognised through discretionary share awards, granted based on performance and business success, reinforcing shared achievements.

At JTC, shared ownership isn’t just a concept – it’s a way of life that empowers us all to contribute meaningfully and benefit from our success. It creates a dynamic environment where everyone’s efforts are aligned and recognised, ensuring we grow and prosper together.

About us
8 Reasons to Invest
We have a 37 year history track record. We’ve combined organic and inorganic strategies to deliver consistent revenue and profitability growth.

Accelerating Together
We run JTC using multi-year business plans that we call eras. They are named for clear identity to support communication, strategic alignment and goal setting across the Group. Each era represents a step-change in growth, innovation and market presence. This forward-thinking strategy ensures that we remain resilient, adaptable and aligned with our long term goals.

Cosmos
Having completed the Galaxy era by the end of 2023, some two years early, in January 2024 we embarked on the Cosmos era, where we aim to double the business for the third time since IPO. Despite the increased size of the Group we believe that this can be achieved within a three to four year timeframe. Given our strong organic growth performance, we will be seeking to maximise the organic contribution during the Cosmos era, while at the same time ensuring that we capture the inorganic opportunities that best fit our platform and long-term goals, as they arise.

JTC Shared Ownership
Shared Ownership is central to JTC’s culture and success. Since 1998, our Employee Benefit Trust has aligned employee and shareholder interests and generated over £450m of total value for employee owners. This model empowers our people, supports our client-first approach and drives exceptional results.
Our programme is the subject of a Harvard Business School MBA case study.

Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees
As envisaged by the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Board has established Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees. The UK Corporate Governance Code requires that the Audit Committee and Remuneration Committee should each have at least three independent non-executive directors and that the Nomination Committee should have at least three directors, a majority of which should be independent non-executive directors.
  Governance and Risk Committee
On 9 December 2022, the Company announced the formation of a stand-alone Governance and Risk Committee of the Board. The Governance and Risk Committee comprises all of the independent non-executive directors. As a result of the formation of the Governance and Risk Committee, the existing Audit and Risk Committee was renamed the ‘Audit Committee’ and the Terms of Reference, including the scope of responsibilities of the Audit Committee, amended appropriately.
Our Committees
Audit
Dermot Mathias
Independent Senior Non-Executive Director and Chair of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises the four independent non-executive directors and is chaired by Dermot Mathias.
The Audit Committee will normally meet at least three times a year at the appropriate times in the reporting cycle. The audit cycle and the external auditor, the Chief Financial Officer and Group Finance Director are all invited to attend Committee meetings on a regular basis. The Committee has responsibility for, amongst other things, the monitoring of the financial integrity of the financial statements of the Group and the involvement of the Group’s auditors in that process, together with providing oversight and advice to the Board in relation to the Company’s system of internal controls and risk management, reviewing and approving various formal reporting requirements.
The Terms of Reference of the Audit Committee cover such issues as membership and the frequency of meetings, as mentioned above, together with requirements of any quorum for and the right to attend meetings. The duties of the Audit Committee covered in the Terms of Reference are: financial reporting, narrative reporting, risk management systems and internal controls, internal audit, external audit, whistleblowing, fraud and engagement with shareholders. The Terms of Reference also set out the authority of the Committee to carry out its duties.

On Demand – The Future of 1031 Webinar: Considering Exchanges Now and Long-Term
Share:
This webinar is now on-demand.
If you don’t know about recent rulings and current interpretations of Section 1031, you may not realize that your property could be eligible for tax deferral.
Real estate investors and the professionals who help them have had plenty to deal with over the past few years, with a pandemic, supply chain issues, inflation, a chaotic market, natural disasters, and potential changes to the tax code that could affect tried-and-true investment strategies.
Among these concerns is IRC Section 1031, which allows property owners to defer taxes on the sale of business or investment property when purchasing a like-kind property. 1031 exchanges have helped taxpayers build wealth and put property to its best use for more than 100 years. With the rapid pace of change in Washington, many property owners might wonder if 1031 exchanges are still a viable strategy.
Like-kind exchanges are not only affected by lawmakers – they’re also continuously evolving through IRS revenue procedures that clarify the nuances of how exchanges can be executed. If you’re not up to date on the latest strategies, you may be missing out. At JTC, we want to make sure our clients and colleagues are abreast of everything they need to know to take full advantage of Section 1031.
On March 19th, join us for a wide-ranging discussion where a group of 1031 experts will discuss current issues affecting 1031 exchanges and how understanding IRS interpretations of this part of the tax code can help you get the most out of your property. RSVP today to reserve your space at this free online event!
Discussion topics may include:
How recent issues like the Southern California wildfires and the new administration in Washington are affecting 1031
The benefits of passive investments like NNN leases and Delaware Statutory Trusts
Combining Section 1031 and Section 121 for primary residences
Permissible exchange expenses and what is allowed under an improvement exchange
Planning ahead for potential changes to the tax code

Understanding 1031 Exchanges: What is Constructive Receipt?
Share:
During a like-kind exchange, the exchanger cannot take actual or constructive receipt of the sales proceeds. Here’s what these terms actually mean and how to make sure you’re doing things right.
When researching Section 1031 like-kind exchanges, you may come across a lot of terminology that you aren’t familiar with. While these terms may seem arbitrary, the rules for like-kind exchanges are strictly interpreted, and have been refined over more than 100 years of legal precedent. It’s important to understand what these phrases mean in the context of 1031 and why they matter.
In a forward exchange (also called a “deferred exchange”), once you sell your relinquished property, the proceeds from that sale are used to purchase your replacement property. These transactions don’t have to be performed simultaneously; in most situations, you have up to 180 days after the relinquished property sale to acquire your replacement property. During that time, the exchanger must avoid “actual or constructive receipt” of the sales proceeds.
What is actual or constructive receipt? The difference is important, as you must avoid both for your exchange to be successful. Let’s take a closer look at these terms and the steps that must be taken to comply with this provision in tax law.
How the IRS defines actual and constructive receipt
Here’s what Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code says regarding the proceeds from the relinquished property sale during a forward exchange:
In the case of a transfer of relinquished property in a deferred exchange, gain or loss may be recognized if the taxpayer actually or constructively receives money or property which does not meet the requirements of section 1031(a) before the taxpayer actually receives like-kind replacement property. If the taxpayer actually or constructively receives money or property which does not meet the requirements of section 1031(a) in the full amount of the consideration for the relinquished property, the transaction will constitute a sale, and not a deferred exchange, even though the taxpayer may ultimately receive like-kind replacement property.
What this says is that if you receive any portion of the sales proceeds (in the form of cash or property) before the replacement property is acquired, that portion will be subject to taxation. And if you receive the entire amount before the replacement property acquisition, the exchange is invalidated, resulting in no tax deferral.
The sales proceeds from the relinquished property sale must go toward the replacement property acquisition, not held by you or used for another purpose. Another section outlines the difference between actual and constructive receipt:
The taxpayer is in actual receipt of money or property at the time the taxpayer actually receives the money or property or receives the economic benefit of the money or property. The taxpayer is in constructive receipt of money or property at the time the money or property is credited to the taxpayer’s account, set apart for the taxpayer, or otherwise made available so that the taxpayer may draw upon it at any time or so that the taxpayer can draw upon it if notice of intention to draw is given.
There are several important points here. “Actual receipt” refers to when you physically control the sales proceeds, or when you receive “economic benefit.” You can’t be given a check for the sale amount, and you also can’t request that the buyer write the check out to a creditor to pay off an unrelated outstanding debt, because that would constitute receiving economic benefit.
“Constructive receipt” refers to when the money is made available to you, even if you don’t physically have it. Sales proceeds can’t be wired to your account, or to any account where you’re able to withdraw funds. They must be in an account from which you can’t make withdrawals, under the supervision of a third party. So how do you set up an account that you can’t draw upon, and who controls this account?
Constructive receipt: the importance of properly structured accounts
As we’ve noted, the Internal Revenue Code can be complex, and exchangers don’t want to end up with large tax obligations because they accidentally violated rules they thought they understood. More direct guidance is available through “Safe Harbor” rules, which outline procedures that, if properly followed, can all but guarantee adherence to the law.
There are many Safe Harbor rules regarding the handling of exchange funds, but a few of note are those that describe the types of bank accounts where your sales proceeds can be held until they are used for the replacement property acquisition:
In the case of a deferred exchange, the determination of whether the taxpayer is in actual or constructive receipt of money or other property before the taxpayer actually receives like-kind replacement property will be made without regard to the fact that the obligation of the taxpayer’s transferee to transfer the replacement property to the taxpayer is or may be secured by cash or a cash equivalent if the cash or cash equivalent is held in a qualified escrow account or in a qualified trust.
What is a qualified escrow or qualified trust? A qualified escrow is an escrow account that follows specific guidelines, including that “the escrow holder is not the taxpayer or a disqualified person” such as the exchanger’s attorney, and “the escrow agreement expressly limits the taxpayer’s rights to receive, pledge, borrow, or otherwise obtain the benefits of the cash or cash equivalent held in the escrow account.”
Similar rules apply to trust accounts. What’s important to understand is that you and your representatives cannot control this account. It must be set up according to Safe Harbor rules by a third party to ensure that you don’t have unrestricted control of the funds. This third party is known as a Qualified Intermediary (QI), a crucial part of a like-kind exchange.
There are some rules for QIs, such as that the QI cannot be “the taxpayer or a disqualified person” and must enter “into a written agreement with the taxpayer” to establish its role in the exchange. Unfortunately, as JTC’s Justin Amos noted, there’s little else limiting who can be a QI or how QIs must operate: “the Qualified Intermediary industry is still an unregulated industry, so there’s not a set of rules or regulations that each QI needs to follow.”
Technically, any third party that does not fall under the definition of a “disqualified person,” which includes “a person who has acted as the taxpayer’s employee, attorney, accountant, investment banker or broker, or real estate agent or broker within the two-year period ending on the date of the transfer of the first of the relinquished properties,” could act as QI. But that doesn’t mean it’s a good idea to ask just anyone; after all, mistakes made by a QI can be costly.
What happens if you take actual or constructive receipt of exchange funds by accident?
It’s important to understand that the IRS isn’t likely to be lenient or understanding if you choose the wrong QI. If you’re found to have taken constructive receipt of funds because of an improperly structured escrow account, the exchange will fail, and “the replacement property received by the taxpayer will be treated as property which is not like kind to the relinquished property.”
One scenario is that you take actual or constructive receipt of funds prior to the acquisition of the replacement property. Realizing that your exchange will be invalid, you decide against acquiring the replacement property so you can use the cash to pay taxes on the relinquished property sale.
Another outcome could be that you don’t realize your exchange is in violation of Safe Harbor rules, and you go ahead and acquire the replacement property. You only find out after the fact, once your tax return has been reviewed by the IRS, that your exchange has been deemed invalid. In this situation, if you’ve already used your full sales proceeds to acquire the replacement property, you may have to sell your newly acquired property to cover the capital gains taxes on the relinquished property sale.
Obviously, those situations are not ideal. To prevent an exchange from being invalidated by the actions of a careless third party, you should never work with a cut-rate QI. Instead, work with a trusted name that knows how to execute a successful exchange.
How to prevent 1031 disaster: finding a QI that understands qualified escrow and trust accounts to avoid constructive receipt
As the law stipulates, in order to perform a 1031 exchange, you need a QI. You also need an exchange agreement prior to your relinquished property sale, and you must avoid actual or constructive receipt of funds. The best way to set yourself up for success is to find a QI that understands Safe Harbor rules and can properly set up an account to hold your sales proceeds.
It’s a bad idea to work with anyone who will try to skirt the rules. The law makes it clear that “this section shall not apply to any exchange which is part of a transaction (or series of transactions) structured to avoid the purposes of this subsection.” Thinking you can outsmart the system is a mistake, and you want a QI that will follow the rules to the letter, not bend them.
You also want to be sure your QI is someone you can trust with those funds; if your QI puts the exchange funds into an account where your funds are commingled with other exchangers’ funds (or other business funds), they could be used improperly and not made available when you need them to acquire your replacement property.
JTC has built its reputation by pioneering best practices for Qualified Intermediaries through many years of successful like-kind exchanges. Our team has experience with all kinds of 1031 exchanges and understands how to follow Safe Harbor rules. All exchange funds are held in qualified escrow or qualified trust accounts, never commingled with other funds, and only released with dual authorization by JTC and the exchanger.
JTC also provides full transparency through our Exchange Manager portal, which allows our clients to view the location and status of their funds at any time, 24/7, from anywhere in the world. We provide thorough documentation, including a full audit trail, so when it’s time to prove to the IRS that your exchange was executed properly, you’ll be prepared.
With JTC, you don’t just get a Qualified Intermediary to hold your funds; you get a trusted partner who can help you execute the exchange that’s best for your situation, letting you maximize the benefits of Section 1031, defer taxes, and invest in your future.

Both those considering EB-5 and those reaching the capital return phase have the same question: is the U.S. a good place to invest right now?
  Beyond EB-5 Webinar: What Does the Current U.S. Economy Mean for Immigrant Investors?
A webinar co-hosted by JTC and CanAm Enterprises
Wednesday, May 7, 2025
2:00 PM – 3:00 PM ET
Hosted via Zoom
REGISTER HERE
Anyone looking to participate in the EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program may be feeling a sense of urgency, with the RIA sunset date approaching and rumblings of a new program intended to replace EB-5. Those seeking permanent residency want to get the visa process started as soon as possible, but they also want to make prudent investments.
Similarly, those whose EB-5 capital has been returned want to make smart choices with their money in their new home. How should they evaluate investment opportunities in an environment where so much is changing?
In the latest webinar from JTC and CanAm Enterprises, we’re taking a look at the U.S. investment landscape before, during, and after the EB-5 process. Join our expert panel for this complimentary event for EB-5 investors, issuers, and anyone interested in understanding the risks and opportunities of the present moment.
Discussion topics may include:
The current state of the U.S. market, including managing uncertainty when evaluating investment projects
Making good choices after EB-5, and how developers can build trusting long-term relationships with investors
Why now may be the ideal time for LATAM investors to consider the United States
Recognizing where opportunities lie amid a changing investment landscape

Institutional Services – Market Entry & Exit for Trust and Fiduciary Solutions
JTC supports other financial service providers wishing to enter or exit the fiduciary market. We can seamlessly transfer their clients to our platforms or assist them through the appropriate process to establish their own setup, using anything from a Managed Trust Company to a simple introducer’s agreement.
Speak to an Expert
Meet the Team
Wealth managers (including private banks, family offices and investment managers) often face crucial decisions regarding their core and non-core services. These decisions become even more acute as their clients become more ‘international’ as their wealth accumulates.
For some wealth managers, this provides an incentive to divest themselves of trust and fiduciary services as they seek to focus on core business. Conversely, wealth managers in developing markets may seek to build share of wallet by actively expanding their suite of services by offering their clients bespoke solutions involving trust and fiduciary services.
In either scenario, by partnering with us, wealth managers are able to focus on their own business model in the knowledge that we provide seamless expertise and experience in a non-competitive and highly complementary environment.
What is a Managed Trust Company (MTC)?
Leading wealth managers in emerging markets often find the MTC arrangement attractive.
In practice, this involves partnering with us for the incorporation and licensing of the MTC, which can be branded consistently with the wealth manager itself. At the same time, the MTC uses JTC’s expertise to provide trust and fiduciary services to perform the outsourced or white labelled administration. In doing so, we provide the regulatory risk and compliance function.
Uniquely, we can assist the MTC to obtain its own cover at highly competitive rates, leveraging our impeccable professional indemnity insurance record and MTC policies and procedures.

“I just wanted to say thank you to JTC and all the team for getting this sorted so quickly, you were fantastic and I just wanted to show my appreciation.”

Practical Sustainability and Impact Solutions
JTC’s sustainability and impact services help you navigate the complex and rapidly evolving sustainability landscape, including the growing body of international regulation and associated disclosures and reporting.
Make an Enquiry
Meet the Team
Sustainability and Impact Services
Our services span advisory, regulatory compliance, outsourced reporting and our virtual Chief Sustainability Officer (vCSO) offering. These services are supported by market-leading technology, and we are proud to partner with Novata as our preferred tech-enabled reporting platform. At JTC, we believe that responsible business practices help to create long-term value. Our sustainability and impact services are designed to support your business in assessing, adopting and integrating a wide range of sustainability principles effectively. Whether you need guidance on regulatory frameworks, implementation of sustainability goals, or support with governance structures, our global team combines deep expertise with practical strategies tailored to your objectives. Let us help you confidently achieve your sustainability ambitions.
Advisory
Our experts in the UK, Europe and the US are able to provide a wide range of advisory services, including Health Checks, gap analysis and ‘proof of capture’ relating to sustainability regulations.
Regulatory Compliance
We can help you navigate the rapidly evolving and increasingly complex sustainability regulatory environment, helping to ensure that your organisation is compliant at all times. We specialise in SFDR, UK SDR, CSRD and TCFD among others.
Outsourced Reporting
The complexity of data collection and processing, including the use of specialist software to enable accurate, efficient and timely reporting sits at the heart of our outsourced reporting service. We have expertise in a wide variety of voluntary and mandatory frameworks and Outsourced Reporting is often a natural extension to our Regulatory Compliance service, allowing clients to focus on their core activities while we take care of the reporting burden. We are proud to partner with Novata as our tech-enabled reporting platform.

“
The growing complexities of sustainability regulation and reporting require both technology and human expertise which is why I’m happy to be announcing our partnership with JTC to offer market-leading solutions that encompass both sustainability technology and advisory services to JTC’s clients around the world.
Conor O’Laoire, Head of Partnerships at Novata
“
We would like to thank JTC, for working with us to assess and offset our carbon footprint. They were pro-active in managing this project for us, ascertaining the carbon footprint of our organisation over three offices globally, arranging the audit of the results, and helping us achieve the necessary carbon offset.
Alternative Investment Managers Association (AIMA)
“
We were recommended JTC’s ESG team through our industry network whilst selecting an independent ESG readiness review provider. They were the clear stand out from several firms. They were efficient, knowledgeable and quick during the diligence process, and were swift to provide feedback following the review itself. We would not hesitate to recommend their services and plan to use them again for further assessment work later this year.
Sandbar Asset Management, CEO
“
As an industry, we have pledged to take action to mitigate climate change risk through sustainable finance. To provide true leadership, we must also work to embed sustainability in our own operations and everyday lives. This means measuring our impact and taking action to reduce or offset our carbon footprint. These small actions add up and we are proud to work with JTC and other innovators across our network to support change towards a more sustainable environment.
Irish Funds, CEO
“
We would like to thank JTC Group, and especially their ESG Services team for working with us to complete the carbon emissions assessment and offset our carbon footprint. They were pro-active in managing this project for us from inception to carbon neutral certification. They helped us with the detail questions and follow-up with our suppliers, took us through the carbon footprint calculations for our organisation, arranged the audit of the results and introduced us to carbon offset options. We would also add that the ESG team exuded a passion for their service, they were keen to help and helped us appreciate a bigger picture even for our own small ESG project. We would certainly recommend their service.

JTC Reports Fast Start to “Cosmos” Era Through Organic and Inorganic Growth in Full Year Results
Share:
Global professional services business JTC has today announced strong full year results with record new business wins and organic growth in-line with upgraded guidance at a stable margin even as the Group continues to invest in growth.
JTC, which is listed as a FTSE 250 company on the London Stock Exchange (“LSE”), reported a 18.6% increase in total revenue to £305.4m with very good net organic growth of 11.3%, in-line with upgraded guidance for the Cosmos era of 10%+ per annum driven by a 15.9% increase in new business wins to a record £35.7m, and a stable underlying EBITDA margin of 33.3%.
The Group has achieved consistent growth during a year of macro uncertainty, notably securing six acquisitions at attractive multiples, including the Citi Trust business, which when completed, will make JTC the world’s leading independent provider of private trust services and will drive JTC’s revenue profile on a pro-forma basis such that the US market becomes the Group’s largest region. This highly disciplined approach to M&A is complemented by the Group’s internal development as JTC adds new services that enhance its core fund, corporate and private client offering, allowing the group to grow its ‘share of wallet’ with existing clients, as well as winning new clients. With a global addressable market for its full range of services that JTC believes is at least $15.3bn per annum in size, there remains enormous opportunity for further long-term growth.
JTC’s Private Client Services (PCS) Division revenue increased strongly by 32.3% to £124.5m (2023: £94.1m) with an increase of 35.2% in underlying EBITDA to £46.4m (2023: £34.3m). The investments made in the PCS platform continued to bear fruit, with net organic revenue growth remaining very strong at 14.0%, while new business wins increased by an excellent 49% to £15.2m (2023: £10.2m). The continued strong organic growth of the Division reflects both the quality and range of JTC’s PCS offering as well as its ability to capture value from acquisitions, in particular those in the US. These successes, along with continued ambitious growth plans and a clear plan to fully integrate the Citi Trust business once regulatory approvals are received, form the foundation of the Division’s plans as it enters the second year of the Cosmos era.
The Group’s Institutional Client Services (ICS) Division, which focuses on fund and corporate services, saw revenues increase by 10.8% to £180.9m (2023: £163.3m) with a 7.2% increase in underlying EBITDA to £55.3m (2023: £51.6m). Underlying EBITDA margin decreased by 1pp to 30.6% (2023: 31.6%) and despite a challenging environment with fewer fund launches and IPO’s, net organic revenue growth was robust at 9.9% following the exceptional performance in the prior year (2023: 19.4%). JTC’s ability to identify and complete value accretive deals continued with four acquisitions completed during the period, the most significant of which was the acquisition of FFP, which was announced in June and completed in November. The acquisition enhances and differentiates the range of fiduciary services JTC can offer to existing and new clients, serving to expand the Group’s overall addressable market.
In recognition of the tremendous success of its Galaxy era business plan, which ran from 2021 to 2023 and saw the Group double in size, in July 2024 JTC made ‘shared ownership’ awards through its Employee Incentive Plan of c. £50m in JTC shares to all eligible employees globally.
The Board was pleased to propose a final dividend of 8.24p, resulting in a 2024 dividend per share of 12.54p (2023: 11.17p), which was a 12.3% increase on the prior year.
Nigel Le Quesne, CEO of JTC PLC, added:
“2024 was the first year of our Cosmos era business plan and we have made a fast start towards our goal of doubling the size of the Group for the third time since IPO. We delivered record new business wins, organic growth above our upgraded guidance and a strong margin, even as we continue to invest in growth.
Alongside the strong organic performance, we announced or completed six acquisitions during the period, including Citi Trust, the global trust company business of Citi Bank. This is a significant addition to our PCS Division and cements JTC’s position of the world’s leading independent trust company business.
We have carried strong momentum into 2025, growing our new business enquiry pipeline, a driver of organic growth, to £55m by the end of Q1 and we maintain a healthy pipeline of further M&A opportunities across both Divisions.
Finally, we were delighted to be able to make an award of c. £50m to our global workforce, in recognition of their collective achievement to double the size of the Group in just three years by delivering our Galaxy era plan. Our commitment to ownership for all employees remains our defining characteristic and I thank our employee-owners for their dedication to our clients and for bringing the JTC culture to life.”

Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG)
Our ESG framework is rooted in our culture of Shared Ownership and reflects our commitment to sustainability and ethical practices. Guided by our values and purpose, we aim to maximise the potential of every client, colleague and partner with whom we work.

We focus on key ESG elements that are meaningful and material to our business, ensuring continuous improvement in areas like carbon neutrality, diversity, and ethical governance. Our aim is to align ESG with commercial strategies, engage our value chain and to enhance our measurement and disclosure.

Environmental
Our environmental efforts are focused on assessing and mitigating the impact of our business operations on the environment. Our objectives include measuring our carbon emissions, striving to achieve net zero by 2040, and expanding our expertise to assist clients in navigating the complex and evolving regulatory landscape on the path to net zero. We are committed to continuous improvement in our environmental practices, ensuring that we contribute positively to the global efforts in combating climate change.

Our Policies
Our Group Policies, which set expected standards in a number of areas linked to professional integrity, include:
Conduct Risk
Anti-Money Laundering
Countering of Terrorist Financing
Anti-Bribery and Corruption
Sanctions Compliance
Insider Trading
Conflicts of Interest and
Whistleblowing, which provides whistleblowers protection from retaliation
All policies are made available to employees via the Group’s intranet. Adherence to these standards is periodically tested through the Group’s ‘Three Lines of Defence’ model of assurance and further supported by an employee compliance declaration exercise undertaken each year.
Modern Anti-Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement
Our statement outlines our dedication to preventing modern slavery within our business and supply chains. We implement rigorous due diligence, extensive staff training, and robust monitoring to mitigate risks. While our policies are comprehensive, we continually review and enhance them to ensure effectiveness. We are dedicated to expanding transparency by publishing more policies publicly, reflecting our commitment to integrity, human rights and accountability.

Reporting Standards
Our ESG disclosures follow global standards, providing transparency and accountability in our sustainability and governance efforts.
Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures
JTC is reporting under the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework, as required under Listing Rule 9.8.6R (8) on a comply or explain basis. We have considered our obligations under this Rule, also taking into account the TCFD Annex (issued October 2021), and have made disclosures consistent with the 11 TCFD Recommendations and Recommended Disclosures; noting that for Metrics and Targets, work is ongoing to establish detailed targets that will enable us to manage climate-related risks and opportunities. We have also considered the FRC’s July 2023 CRR Thematic review of climate-related metrics and targets.
Sustainability Accounting Standards Board
We have chosen to provide disclosures in line with the Professional & Commercial Services Standard issued by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB). SASB was founded in 2011 as a not-for-profit, independent standards setting organisation to establish and maintain industry specific standards to assist in disclosing financially material, decision-useful sustainability information to investors. The information disclosed is to assist investors and other stakeholders in understanding the governance and management of the Group’s environmental and social impacts arising from its activities as well as the ability of the Group to create value over the long term.
More about SASB
External Initiatives and Frameworks
JTC has chosen to participate in several external initiatives and frameworks which help us stay informed on how other firms globally are dealing with these challenges.
JTC Shared Ownership
People are Central to JTC
Shared ownership is central to JTC’s culture and success. Since 1998, our Employee Benefit Trust has aligned employee and shareholder interests and generated over £450m of total value for employee-owners. This model empowers our people, supports our client-first approach and drives exceptional results.
Our programme is the subject of a Harvard Business School MBA case study.

As a new joiner, my experience at JTC has exceeded expectations so far. I feel lucky to have joined a team and department that has been welcoming and supportive. Starting a new career can be daunting, but the relaxed and friendly vibe in the office helped me feel settled quickly.

Overall, I feel very positive about starting a new career here at JTC, and hopeful for the future.

Joining JTC has been an exciting and rewarding journey, especially as an early-career professional. In my first few months, I’ve had the opportunity to learn key skills that are shaping my growth and understanding of the industry. What stands out the most is the welcoming and supportive environment created by my team and colleagues. Their guidance and willingness to share their knowledge have made it easy to integrate into the company and start contributing. I’m looking forward to continuing this learning journey and developing both professionally and personally with such a fantastic team.

My experience working with JTC so far has been thoroughly enjoyable. Everyone around me has helped me settle in the best I could and have helped me develop my understanding and learning of the financial sector.
