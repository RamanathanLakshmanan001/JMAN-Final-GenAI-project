About Initium
No getting away from it...
Selling your business may be the most challenging experience of your working life – and many shareholders enter the process woefully underprepared. According to FT Advisor, over 60% of UK business owners have no defined exit plan in place, and Forbes reports that globally, only ~20% of businesses taken to market ever sell. You know the cliché: fail to plan, plan to fail.
At Initium®, we’re all about the plan, and our experience is the polar opposite, with a success rate of over 80%*. We’ll guide you on the first steps towards a more valuable future, and get you exactly where you want to go. We will help you:
Understand, shape and maximise the true value in your business prior to an exit
Secure the best possible deal terms when the right time comes to sell
Achieve freedom, create lasting impact, and exceed your expectations post-sale
*Based on transactions completed 2020-2024
What we do
If you’re a decision-maker in a privately owned business who…
Is committed to building a lasting legacy for your business, your team and your clients
Generates at least £1m EBITDA, with ambition to reach £2m+
Is forward-thinking, open to ideas, and focused on growth
Has an ultimate sale price expectation of at least £10m
Wants to deliver positive impact and outcomes for all
We can guide you through…
Driving value in your business
For shareholders seeking an evidence-based valuation of your business, and a long-term roadmap for growth and exit
Value my business
Selling your business
For shareholders looking to pursue a company sale in the next 12 months, including to trade buyers, Private Equity, or even your own staff
Sell my business
Unlocking life post sale
Find your freedom as part of our network of 250+ former clients pursuing new goals and opportunities
Next-stage strategies
Why Initium?
At Initium, we are building on a 35-year history that shows that value goes way beyond the deal itself. We’ve seen hundreds of clients sell for far more than they expected and go on to do amazing things with the freedoms and opportunities a business sale can provide.
Why us? Because we transform, not just transact.
Initium is a very different kind of corporate finance advisor:
We’re employee-owned, so everyone you speak to at Initium understands the business-owner mindset
We only work for sellers, not buyers – meaning we’re totally shareholder centric, and focused exclusively on maximising the outcome for you
We’re committed to our clients, our colleagues and our communities, supporting a range of organisations whose values and purpose align with ours
We’re all about putting people first, thinking big in everything we do, and always pursuing the exceptional.

Our partners
At Initium, we speak personally to entrepreneurial business owners every day, all of whom have differing needs on their business growth and exit journeys.
There is simply no one-size-fits all. For some, a business sale process is on the cards, for others it may be years away. Some are looking for advice on strategic growth and change, such as exploring investment options or employee ownership. Some have been approached unexpectedly by a potential investor. For others, a change of personal circumstances could prompt a conversation, and they just want to talk, in confidence, to get a new perspective on where to take their business next.
We want to do the right thing, at the right time. So whatever your position, we consider an exploratory conversation a good use of our time. And if we can’t help you with your plans… we will know someone who can.
The Initium partner ecosystem
To help support business owners, we have built an ecosystem of trusted independent professional partners, across complementary disciplines as diverse as wealth management, business coaching and mentoring, employment law, corporate law, finance, recruitment, fractional board support and many more. That’s in addition to our unique network of former clients, The Fellows, who regularly refer their contacts to us, and are happy to offer their invaluable personal insights to other entrepreneurs.
Our partner relationships are built solely on professional trust and shared values. As an employee-owned business, we passionately believe in building long-term, sustainable, added-value relationships.
So if our services are not right for you at the current time, we won’t force you into discussing something you don’t want, or need. We’ll put you in touch with someone who can help you.
Likewise, many of our clients are referred directly to us by trusted partners, who know we can offer independent, impartial and expert advice on the biggest business decision of your life.
Why do partners refer clients to Initium?
Experience: 35+ years’ credentials and direct experience across sectors and deal types
Independence: we only ever work for private business owners – so we’re focused on getting the right outcome
Trust: close post-sale relationships with former clients, The Fellows
Expertise: real-time insights and analysis on what’s happening in the M&A marketplace
Services for partners
For our partners, we’re always at the end of the phone to offer you and your clients initial insight and guidance into the variety of growth and exit options available to business owners.
Our regular partner initiatives include:
A regular newsletter, including deal updates and valuable real time data/insights from the M&A marketplace
Complimentary invitations to high-end, inspiring and exclusive events– we can invite you and your clients as an introduction to how we work
Provide a subject expert to your business from our network of Fellows and associates, who can speak at your meetings, conferences and events
Exclusive dinners, where our former clients share their stories, answer your questions in confidence, and provide 1-2-1 advice
Providing an expert panel for any client events you host, focused on your sector, and your attendees’ needs
If you’re interested in becoming a referring partner, get in touch with us to find out how we can help you, your clients and your networks

About us
The corporate version...
Initium is a specialist sell-side corporate finance firm. We support the shareholders of ambitious privately owned businesses with company valuation and consultancy services, succession/exit planning advice, and business sale transaction services.
An employee-owned advisor, based near Newbury, UK, Initium specialises in working on sale transactions with a typical Enterprise Value from £10m to £100m. Our extensive track record of completed deals includes full company sales to strategic trade acquirers in the UK and overseas, growth capital transactions, cash-out deals with Private Equity investors, Employee Ownership Trust (EOT) transactions and more.
We advise clients across multiple sectors, but have noted expertise in the Healthcare, Telecoms, Media and Technology (TMT), Testing, Inspection, Certification and Compliance (TICC) and Industrials sectors.
We specialise in helping clients with their next-stage strategies via our unique network of former clients, The Fellows, which assists shareholders to unlock personal and professional development opportunities post sale.
The ‘plain English’ version...
We’ll help you identify the value and potential in your business. We’ll help you build your business for sale. Then, when the right time comes, we’ll help you sell your business.
But we’ll do much more than that. We understand that this is a big, big decision, so we’ll guide and support you throughout, going above and beyond to secure the best possible outcomes. That’s not just for you personally, but for your company, its legacy, and your team – the people who have helped make your business great.
As an Initium client, you’ll become a part of our unique community of Fellows, former clients (and now friends!) who have unlocked new opportunities and work/life balance post sale.

Community
At Initium, we’re dedicated to creating positive, enduring impact. A commitment to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and ‘giving back’ has been part of the DNA of our business since we were first established in the late 1980s. Our transition to employee ownership in 2022 has meant even greater focus in this area, and we have established a dedicated Community Team to manage and allocate our charity budget, and plan and deliver a range of initiatives.
We have long contributed a proportion of revenues to charitable causes in the UK and in India, via The Snowdrop Foundation, a charity established by our founders. As part of Initium’s core values and commitment to giving back, we have set an ambitious target of 30% of profits distributed to impact causes by 2030.
Our founders’ charity is changing lives in India
Co-owner colleagues take part in volunteer days
…and a whole host of other fundraising initiatives
Multiple fundraising initiatives
Our charity of the year for 2025 is Life + Limb, dedicated to training front line health workers to manage and care for people suffering from (major) injuries using the Primary Trauma Care (PTC) course. Past charities of the year include Simon Says, and we are proud to have established partnerships with the Berkshire and Cheshire Community Foundations – regional charitable organisations who raise and distribute money directly to vital local causes.
Other organisations close to the business include Basingstoke-based The Safe – a non-profit charity offering support to families including Pregnancy Crisis, Post-Abortion, Miscarriage and Bereavement – and Newbury Cancer Care, which team members have supported via a series of volunteer days. All Initium colleagues are encouraged to take paid time off to volunteer for and help a wide range of organisations of their choice.
Recent fundraising highlights include the team walking the Jurassic Coast for Simon Says, and Liz Jackson’s 50 for 50 campaign, where Liz – who is blind – took on some daredevil initiatives including a half-marathon on roller skates, and abseiling down the UK’s tallest sculpture, the ArcelorMittal Orbit in London!

The Snowdrop Foundation
Our founders, the Rebbettes family, witnessed the suffering and poverty of those in dire need and felt compelled to take action. In 2002, driven by this desire to help, they established The Snowdrop Foundation, a registered charity (number 1093474).
The Snowdrop Foundation was founded with a simple aim: to support and provide opportunities to the poorest and most vulnerable in society. Through projects in India and closer to home in the UK, the charity focuses on supporting orphaned children, widows, and young mothers or mothers-to-be. The Foundation seeks to reduce hardship and build a brighter future for those in the darkest and most desperate circumstances.
St Mark’s School has educated thousands of children from the poorest communities
The Snowdrop Foundation has funded many overseas initiatives to aid the needy. One such project is the construction of the three-storey St Mark’s School in Kakinada, India, which educates over 500 children from the lowest tier of Indian society.
St Mark’s School provides these children with a life-changing opportunity for a positive future, not only for themselves but also for their families and communities. Over the last 20 years, thousands of pupils from the poorest backgrounds have been educated and supported as they move through further education, then university to employment. It is a delight to see young adults from such deprived beginnings start to forge their own lives, become self-sufficient and gain hope for a future beyond poverty.
Additionally, the Foundation has supported various other projects in India, such as the construction of a much-needed orphanage in Bangalore, which provides safety, shelter and comfort to abandoned and orphaned children. Rural schools and communities in Andhra Pradesh have also benefitted from the Foundation’s efforts, along with ostracised leper colonies and many sick and needy individuals.
At Initium, we believe supporting charitable causes positively influences personal and professional development of all staff. As CEO Jonathan Dunn says: “For Initium, charity isn’t a gimmick or a trend. All our co-owner colleagues appreciate that it’s a real opportunity to create impact and change lives in a way that benefits those in society who are much less fortunate than ourselves.”

Why work with Initium?
At Initium, we are building on a 35-year history that shows that value goes way beyond the deal itself. We’ve seen hundreds of clients sell for far more than they expected and go on to do amazing things with the freedom and opportunities a business sale can provide.

About Initium
No getting away from it...
Selling your business may be the most challenging experience of your working life – and many shareholders enter the process woefully underprepared. According to FT Advisor, over 60% of UK business owners have no defined exit plan in place, and Forbes reports that globally, only ~20% of businesses taken to market ever sell. You know the cliché: fail to plan, plan to fail.
At Initium®, we’re all about the plan, and our experience is the polar opposite, with a success rate of over 80%*. We’ll guide you on the first steps towards a more valuable future, and get you exactly where you want to go. We will help you:
Understand, shape and maximise the true value in your business prior to an exit
Secure the best possible deal terms when the right time comes to sell
Achieve freedom, create lasting impact, and exceed your expectations post-sale
*Based on transactions completed 2020-2024
What we do
If you’re a decision-maker in a privately owned business who…
Is committed to building a lasting legacy for your business, your team and your clients
Generates at least £1m EBITDA, with ambition to reach £2m+
Is forward-thinking, open to ideas, and focused on growth
Has an ultimate sale price expectation of at least £10m
Wants to deliver positive impact and outcomes for all
We can guide you through…
Driving value in your business
For shareholders seeking an evidence-based valuation of your business, and a long-term roadmap for growth and exit
Value my business
Selling your business
For shareholders looking to pursue a company sale in the next 12 months, including to trade buyers, Private Equity, or even your own staff

Why us? Because we transform, not just transact.
Initium is a very different kind of corporate finance advisor:
We’re employee-owned, so everyone you speak to at Initium understands the business-owner mindset
We only work for sellers, not buyers – meaning we’re totally shareholder centric, and focused exclusively on maximising the outcome for you
We’re committed to our clients, our colleagues and our communities, supporting a range of organisations whose values and purpose align with ours
We’re all about putting people first, thinking big in everything we do, and always pursuing the exceptional.

Selling your business
When the right time comes to sell your business, Initium can assist you with a range of different transaction advisory services. Whichever is right for you, you can be assured it will be tailored entirely to your objectives, and we will create, manage and deliver a bespoke strategy on your behalf.
Let’s find you the best buyer, offering the best fit, the best value, and best outcomes for you, your business, and your people…
Our transaction advisory services
A full company sale – Following a comprehensive preparation phase encompassing financial forecasting, research, documentation and more, we identify and approach a range of carefully selected and approved potential acquirers and investors, delivering hands-on management of a highly competitive sale process.
Buyer negotiation – If you’ve already been approached by a buyer and/or are in possession of a proceedable offer, we can advise on the terms and structure of your deal, and manage all elements to completion. If appropriate, we also engage other parties to introduce competitive tension.
Growth capital investment and partial company sales – This route is ideal for ambitious business owners/decision makers who wish to remain with their business in the longer term, and are seeking an investor partner whose resources can ‘fast-track’ company growth, and de-risk your personal financial position.
Employee Ownership Trusts (EOTs) – The move to employee ownership can be transformational, as you reward your teams for their part in your company’s success with a meaningful stake in the company. We’re an EOT ourselves, and for the right company, this is a win-win scenario, culturally and commercially.
Management Buy Outs (MBOs) / Management Buy-Ins (MBIs) – We can advise on working alongside your existing management team to secure funding for the deal, and drive your company’s future under their ownership; or by profiling external management teams with the right expertise and cultural fit to take your business forward.
Corporate divestments – The sale of a profitable, but non-core, trading division may be the best route for a larger, corporate organisation wishing to streamline group operations, and we can advise larger companies considering their strategies.

Benefits of working with us on your company sale
We’re impartial. Initium is sell-side only – meaning we only ever work with shareholders looking to sell
We’re independent with no reliance on buyers. Many advisors work ‘both sides’ of the deal table, creating conflicts of interest
We think laterally in profiling buyers, and go beyond the usual suspects. ~50% of clients sell to overseas-based acquirers
We specialise in you. Our day job is selling privately owned businesses. This is all we do – which is why we’re so good at it!
We’ve seen it all. With a portfolio of hundreds of transactions, we’ve been there, done that, and got the t-shirt across multiple industries
We’re by your side. We pride ourselves on close relationships with clients before, during and long after a deal completes
Frequently Asked Questions
Business owners considering a sale process typically have a lot – and we mean a lot – of questions. On our FAQ homepage, we’ve collated responses to the most common questions we’re asked.
These all are genuine questions, put to us by business owners in multiple sectors, and at very different stages of their succession/exit planning. Some are high level (“How do you sell a business?”); others are technical (“Why is Working Capital calculation important?”). In every case, the Initium team gives straight answers to straight questions, and provide links to related topics.

Unlocking life post-sale
Your partnership with us doesn’t finish once your transaction completes. Become part of Initium’s unique network of 250+ former clients – the Fellows – who have used the sale of their business as a springboard to explore new opportunities, and create lasting impact.
Our Fellows community proves that a business sale isn’t the end. It’s just the start…
Find your freedom as a Fellow
Selling a business and planning life after a transaction can be a lonely experience. Not anymore.
Initium’s Fellows Group is a unique post-transaction network of our former clients, all of whom have successfully sold all or part of their businesses. The founding principles are to share ideas and advice and build personal and professional contacts, supporting the transition to life after a sale.
Our Fellows tell us that their deals had a huge and enduring impact on their quality of life. They all speak of freedom, time, choice, restoring control, and the opportunity to pursue life-long passions. Many mention improved health, fitness, and family relationships.
This exclusive community is, we believe, the largest of its type in the world – and it’s growing with every client we work with.

What will you do?
The range of activities our Fellows pursue post sale will astonish you. Some choose to give back, donating time to establishing charitable foundations, becoming Non Executive Directors, Foundation Trustees, or mentoring, coaching and advising other businesses.
Others start new business ventures, often in entirely unrelated sectors. From writing best-selling novels, via a new role as a Football Club chairman, to opening a theme park, some start to live out long-held dreams…
“I know… I’ll start a swim school!”
Whatever they do, most initially struggled to come to terms with letting go, and establishing a new identity beyond owning a business. That’s why before, during and after a sale, our clients all appreciate the chance to speak to other Fellows, and compare experiences. As Fellow Andrew Sesemann – who has sold two businesses with us – explains: “Only other entrepreneurs completely understand the issues involved in running and selling your own business.”
For many corporate finance advisors, a transaction is the end goal. At Initium, the clue’s in our name. It’s just the beginning.

What is impact beyond the deal?
Impact beyond the deal means providing a lived experience to our clients and our colleagues that is beyond expectations and unrivalled in our industry – delivering real and enduring impact way beyond a business sale transaction itself.

Driving value in your business
From an initial company valuation to a long-term business growth strategy, Initium can help you build and enhance the value in your business. Together, we can maximise the outcome when the right time comes to pursue a company sale.
We offer a modular consultancy service, with all elements customised to you, your company and your goals ─ business and personal
1
Step 1: Business valuation
Valuing a business is an art, not a science. The value of your business is never just about the financials, and you won’t get an accurate business valuation just by punching some numbers into a spreadsheet.
With the Initium® Value Assessment service – aimed at companies with £1m+ EBITDA and ambition to grow – you’ll get the full picture of what your business is worth, and why. This is a multi-part, data-driven and reality-rooted exercise, tailored to your business. It’s based on our decades of deal-making experience, a range of qualitative and quantitative factors, and our real-time understanding of what’s happening in your market.
This is your definitive reality check. Over a few weeks, we’ll help you gather the data we need to analyse your underlying profitability, quality of revenues, cost base, working capital, sales pipeline and many more value-critical KPIs.
We’ll explain the big picture factors driving deals in your marketplace, benchmark you against competitors, assess the value in your brand and market position, and identify any potential risks that might limit your attractiveness and ultimate sale price. And as a Value Assessment client, you’ll become an Honorary Fellow and gain access to our exclusive community of like-minded entrepreneurs.

Steps 2, 3, 4 and more: Goal-setting and unlocking shareholder value
Value Assessment is a standalone service, but for many clients, it’s also the first element of our consultancy-led Initium® Value Maximiser programme.
That’s where we embark on a longer-term partnership with ambitious entrepreneurs on the road towards a business sale transaction.
Each Value Maximiser engagement is bespoke to you and your business. So firstly, we need to understand what’s most important to you:
What do you want to achieve?
What does life post sale look like for you?
What about your staff?
When is the right time to sell for you?
Once you know where you are, we’ll help you imagine where you want to be. All you need then is a Road Map!
Ultimately, we’ll shape your business to be fully transaction ready, helping you get maximum value at the optimum time, via a fully managed sale process.
In total, Initium has unlocked over £3bn of value for our clients, and this tailored programme has increased company values by 2.5x within 36 months on average. And as an Initium Fellow, we help you find meaning and opportunity as a full member of our exclusive network of 250+ founders who have successfully sold their businesses with us.

Client testimonials
Selling your business is a complex, challenging process, and it’s essential to have someone you trust in to guide and support you at all times. Here, our former clients offer first-hand insights on working with the team at Initium
“In considering the sale of my business, it was important for me to feel a connection with the team who would be supporting me on this journey.
I wanted to work with people who were experienced and professional, down to earth and honest, supportive and caring, and who were also able to have a bit of fun along the way. I found these qualities and more in the whole team, who supported me throughout”
– Louise Sharp, Makara Health, sold to Precision Value & Health
View transaction
“We thoroughly enjoyed working with you and were impressed with your professionalism, depth of knowledge and continuous enthusiasm.
Your support during the identifying opportunity stage, preparation and transaction work was first class, making navigating a challenging process manageable and transparent at all times. You really were the ideal partner, leading to an excellent deal for all parties.”
– Tony Bosley and Peter Schultheiss, Geotek, sold to Judges Scientific plc
View transaction
“Your hands-on support and expertise throughout the transaction – and indeed for years beforehand – has been excellent. Timing is everything, and the wise counsel we received from your team was a big part of the decision on when to come to market and seek the right acquirer for our business. You are a very impressive collective; a great team has to be a ‘Ministry of Talents’, and that’s you, for sure.”
– Russell Caldwell and Neill Crone, OWM, sold to Normec
View transaction
“You brought not only the M&A expertise we required to negotiate a ‘once in a lifetime’ transaction to the best possible conclusion – but also provided extensive support in so many other ways to take on much of the work and minimise disruption to the business during the sale process. I have no doubt that this deal would not have happened if we had not been working with you.”
– Dan Melhuish, LMS, sold to DocGo
View transaction
“We’re so happy with the outcome, and, as our advisor, you made it all possible. We were totally in the dark about how a business sale works, and most certainly could not have achieved this without your calm, professional advice”
– Gerry McDonagh, RSL, sold to IPCOM
View transaction
“For anyone considering their business sale options, we would most certainly recommend Initium. They have the experience, knowledge, expertise, and the track record to get you the best outcomes and, perhaps most importantly, they are supportive, brilliant, friendly people to deal with.”
– John Shanahan, EHM, sold to Bunzl plc
View transaction
“It has been such an amazing and satisfying experience having you guide us through the journey and complexities of finding a buyer for our business.
We did not know what to expect from a sale process at the outset, but the team were always there to support and advise us, providing strong partnership and leadership from preparation through to completion.”
– Melissa and John Nicholson, Kettlewell Colours, sold to Refined Brands Group
View transaction
“The advisory team were superb in helping us navigate what was an incredibly complex sale process.
This was a challenging process and we could not have done it without the teamwork and purpose displayed by our team. The advice was solid and collaborative, but the manner of working was superb: calm and considered, yet firm when it was required.”
– Rob Naybour, CEO, Weston Williamson + Partners, joins EGIS
View transaction
“You managed the sales process superbly. We were impressed at your depth of knowledge, the depth of the team and how people were brought in at the appropriate time, also the hand holding, if it was necessary, and the reassurance.”
– Michael Spencer, Tew Engineering, sold to LB Foster Inc
View transaction
“We could not have hoped for a more suitable buyer for our business – namely an international player looking for a UK footprint and with the ambition and resources to significantly grow our business. You found that buyer, and helped us every step of the way.”
– Chris Gorton, Heads Recruitment, sold to Proman
View transaction
“My experience with [a previous M&A transaction] was horrific, so this time I wanted to hire an advisor good at selling businesses.
I had expertise in my area of business, but didn’t have any expertise in knowing the kinds of companies who might want to buy – or could buy – my business. Coming to a third-party advisor, who is an expert in multiple sectors, and where to look, seemed sensible.”
– Guy Mills - GBUK Healthcare, received investment from H2 Equity Partners
View transaction
“Choosing an advisor we could trust and who would support us was critical. Honestly, I don’t think we could have made a better decision – you not only supported us throughout the entire process but advised on a lawyer partner and both were right by our side whenever we needed.
If I had to go through the whole process again, I’d choose you in a heartbeat.”
– Phil O’Brien – Concise, sold to PSAV (now Encore)
View transaction
“You understand the pressure a sale process places on business owners and you expertly managed that process for us every step of the way”
– Charlie Shaw and Alison Turney, joint founders of Gold-Vision, sold to Volaris
View transaction
“We’ve secured an ideal outcome, and a little bit of history for our sector. None of this could have been achieved without your support and expert advice. You were in our corner, always”
– Matt Boland and Simon Stoll, Audiologic, sold to EAV Group
View transaction
“We valued and relied on your support and expert advice throughout the preparation and sale phases, and your hands-on partnership approach as our advisor was crucial. Particularly pleasing was the amount of interest you generated from acquirers both in UK and Europe. This created a genuinely competitive process. You gave us choice.”
– Adam Beattie and Paul McKenna, Evolution, sold to Phenna Group
View transaction
“We chose you to act for us based on what you told us you would do, and you exceeded our expectations in every respect. I have nothing but praise for your organisation and professionalism, and above all you were a fantastic bunch of people to work with”
– Bill Mayne, MSS Group, sold to RSK
View transaction
“We would never have got this deal over the line without you. The team we had was outstanding”
– Ben Harrington, Dawbarn, sold to Shur-Co®
View transaction
“You have been with us every step of our sale journey. Your deal-making expertise and commitment has ensured a great outcome and secured an exciting future”
– Mark Garrison, Premier Components, sold to AutoCirc AB
View transaction
What is impact beyond the deal?
Impact Beyond The Deal means providing a lived experience to our clients and our colleagues that is beyond expectations and unrivalled in our industry – delivering real and enduring impact way beyond a business sale transaction itself.

Who we are
Initium is a specialist corporate finance advisor, partnering with privately owned businesses up to, during and beyond a business sale transaction. A proudly employee-owned business, we work exclusively on the ‘sell side’ – advising ambitious business owners exploring their growth and future exit strategies.
We specialise in transactions with a typical deal value between £10m-£100m, and have unlocked over £3bn of value for our clients across multiple sectors throughout our 35+ year history. Find out more about us here.
Our why as a business is clear: we want to create impact beyond the deal
What on earth do you mean by that?
Established as BCMS in 1989, we became employee owned in 2022, and rebranded as Initium in 2024 – the same year we were recognised as one of The Sunday Times Best Places to Work.
All our co-owner colleagues were involved in the rebranding process, and our name reflects our approach – Initium is taken from the Latin word for starting point.
For many corporate finance advisors, a successful business sale transaction marks where their relationship with a client will end. For Initium, it’s just the beginning, as we look to help entrepreneurs find their freedom, purpose and new opportunities in the next stage of their lives, as evidenced by our unique community of former clients, The Fellows.
There’s so much more we’d love to tell you – about our values as a business, our ecosystem of partners, our community work, our Diamonds network for women-led businesses. The links below will help you get to know us a bit better!

Unlocking life post-sale
Your partnership with us doesn’t finish once your transaction completes. Become part of Initium’s unique network of 250+ former clients – the Fellows – who have used the sale of their business as a springboard to explore new opportunities, and create lasting impact.
Our Fellows community proves that a business sale isn’t the end. It’s just the start…
Find your freedom as a Fellow
Selling a business and planning life after a transaction can be a lonely experience. Not anymore.
Initium’s Fellows Group is a unique post-transaction network of our former clients, all of whom have successfully sold all or part of their businesses. The founding principles are to share ideas and advice and build personal and professional contacts, supporting the transition to life after a sale.
Our Fellows tell us that their deals had a huge and enduring impact on their quality of life. They all speak of freedom, time, choice, restoring control, and the opportunity to pursue life-long passions. Many mention improved health, fitness, and family relationships.
This exclusive community is, we believe, the largest of its type in the world – and it’s growing with every client we work with.

What will you do?
The range of activities our Fellows pursue post sale will astonish you. Some choose to give back, donating time to establishing charitable foundations, becoming Non Executive Directors, Foundation Trustees, or mentoring, coaching and advising other businesses.
Others start new business ventures, often in entirely unrelated sectors. From writing best-selling novels, via a new role as a Football Club chairman, to opening a theme park, some start to live out long-held dreams…
“I know… I’ll start a swim school!”
Whatever they do, most initially struggled to come to terms with letting go, and establishing a new identity beyond owning a business. That’s why before, during and after a sale, our clients all appreciate the chance to speak to other Fellows, and compare experiences. As Fellow Andrew Sesemann – who has sold two businesses with us – explains: “Only other entrepreneurs completely understand the issues involved in running and selling your own business.”
For many corporate finance advisors, a transaction is the end goal. At Initium, the clue’s in our name. It’s just the beginning.

Our values
At Initium, we want the work we do to have a positive impact in three distinct areas. These are as follows:
Clients
We want to help those who work with us to maximise value in their companies, and exceed their expectations before, during and after a transaction. Because we build such strong relationships with clients, we know a sale has impact far beyond financial security – it delivers opportunities, better work/life balance, and freedom to pursue new goals.
Our track record
Colleagues
Initium is an employee-owned business, and every single member of staff has a genuine stake and say in how our company is run. We are determined to make a career at Initium more fulfilled, varied, meaningful and enjoyable than anywhere else – and we were recognised as one of The Sunday Times Best Places To Work in 2024.
Meet our team
Community
In 2002, our founders established our own charitable organisation, The Snowdrop Foundation, active in the UK and India. Additionally, we have a dedicated Community Team, through which we support a wide range of charities important to us. Our goal as a business is to commit 30% of profits to impact causes by 2030.
CSR and giving back
Value 1: Putting People First
We care deeply: people first – relationships before transactions, acting beyond self. We celebrate our diversity, different voices and unique value. We listen and challenge assumptions, with a humble confidence and courage.
Value 2: Pursuing the Exceptional
We’re all about the relentless pursuit of excellence. We make proactive, informed decisions throughout our relationships – our destination is in the detail. We learn, adapt and thrive through adversity and challenges.
Value 3: Thinking Big
We inspire and empower each other to think bigger, harnessing our full potential. We collaborate all the way for success, supporting each other’s dreams and ambitions. We do what we say we will do, we do the right thing – with integrity and authenticity – giving our all, all the time.
How our clients see us
We have an impressive Net Promoter Score (NPS) of 78. Here’s a selection of our clients’ survey responses… 
“Having been through two sales processes - one with a large Global M&A advisory firm and one with you - I would recommend you first every time”
