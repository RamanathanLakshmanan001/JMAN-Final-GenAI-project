About Us
Gafa` Notaries & Associates is a Maltese notarial law firm operating from offices in the North and South of Malta, in Mosta and Paola respectively. With over 30 years of experience in the field, we have nowadays evolved into a fully-fledged notarial law firm committed to servicing our vast clientele with the dedication, expertise and professionalism that our esteemed clients have come to expect from us.
Our Focus
Here at Gafa` Notaries & Associates, our focus is predominantly centred around civil law; specifically the fields of contract, property, family and succession law. Being Notaries Public and Commissioners for Oaths enables us to offer a multitude of legal services ranging from property transfers, loans and other contracts to matrimonial agreements, inheritance and estate planning.
Complementing our work with a wide spectrum of legal advisory services enables us to guarantee our clients a pragmatic, efficient and cost-effective solution in achieving any desired end-result.
Our History
Gafa` Notaries & Associates may trace its conception to the year 1991 when Dr. Carmel Gafa` set up his own private notarial practice. With a foothold in both the North and South of Malta, the firm has grown exponentially from its humble beginnings, adapting itself over the years to cater for the ever-changing exigencies of the local legal system. Notwithstanding its growth, the firm retained its reliable backbone as a principally family-run business, roping in several legal interns, secretaries and working with a myriad of professional entities including banks, audit firms, architects and lawyers to ensure a comprehensive service. This enabled the firm to expand without foregoing its client-centric modus operandi.
Following in his father’s footsteps nowadays is Dr. Daniele Gafa` who aspires to uphold the firm’s core values of dedication, professionalism, and trustworthiness. By adopting a modern outlook, the two are committed to lead the firm to new heights.
Celebrating 30 Years Of Experience.
