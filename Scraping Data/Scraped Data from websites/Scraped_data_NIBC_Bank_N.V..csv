Our History
NIBC was founded in 1945, with the aim of providing financing to visionary entrepreneurs who helped rebuild the Netherlands after World War II. Over the years, we have evolved into an entrepreneurial bank focused on financing, advising and co-investing.
After emerging from the 2008 financial crisis without government support, we reinvented ourselves: as a flexible bank that can act quickly, with a ""THINK YES"" mentality and a ""can do"" attitude as strong as our clients. We have since achieved many milestones: the introduction of mortgage and savings products, BEEQUIP, Lot Mortgages and yesqar. Over the years, we have been able to build on our entrepreneurial DNA and develop NIBC into the bank it is today; the bank that enables ambitions by financing assets for consumers and entrepreneurs. Now and in the future.

Our Value Chain
Engaging with our stakeholders in a proactive way and on a continuous basis is central to our strategy and the ambition to achieve sustainable growth. We carefully weigh the interests of our stakeholders in our decision-making.
Stakeholders are groups or individuals who are affected by or can affect the achievements of our objectives. They include clients, employees, investors, regulators, rating agencies and society at large.
We do this by staying in dialogue with our clients, ranging from constant dialogue to direct requests for feedback and the annual materiality assessments. The materiality assessments take place annually and provide critical clarity about how our company should focus its resources and which aspects are most important to our stakeholders.
The outcome of this process and the feedback of our stakeholders is described in more detail within our Annual Report.

MiFID II
The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, MiFID has been applicable across the European Union since November 2007. It is a cornerstone of the EU's regulation of financial markets seeking to improve the competitiveness of EU financial markets by creating a single market for investment services and activities and to ensure a high degree of harmonised protection for investors in financial instruments.
Following the financial crisis of 2008, the European legislators have adopted an amendment to MiFID I, including a revised Directive and a new Regulation, together referred to as MiFID II. MiFID II takes into account the evolution of financial markets and addresses the weakness revealed by the implementation of MiFID I. MiFID II further extends the requirements of MiFID I, with the aim of making financial markets more efficient, resilient as well as transparent and to enhance investor protection. MiFID II results in a large number of requirements, both for NIBC Group (hereafter “NIBC”) as well as for the external contacts of NIBC with its clients.
