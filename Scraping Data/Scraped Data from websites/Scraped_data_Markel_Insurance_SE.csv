UK Tax Strategy Information
In compliance with our duty under Section 19(2) and 25, Schedule 19 of the Finance Act 2016 we, the companies listed below, publish the following UK tax strategy for the financial year ended 31 December 2024.
Introduction
Our parent company, Markel Group Inc, is a US-based diverse financial holding company with international operations. Its operations in the UK are divided into 3 categories as follows:
Markel International (“International”) - The principal business of the International group is the marketing and underwriting of specialty insurance products. For a list of UK companies within the International group please see below.
Nephila - The principal business of the Nephila group is investment management in a broad range of investment products, including insurance-linked securities, catastrophe bonds, insurance swaps, and climate/weather-related risk transfer solutions. For a list of UK companies within the Nephila group please see below.
AMF Bakery - AMF Bakery Systems (UK) Ltd sits within the Markel Ventures group. Markel Ventures owns and operates a family of companies outside the insurance industry. The principal business of the company is to sell bakery equipment, parts, and services.
We are committed to the core principles of the Markel Style, which is our parent company's statement of commercial ethos and is found here.
Our financial goals are to earn consistent underwriting and operating profits and superior investment returns to build shareholder value.We have a strong focus on corporate responsibility and a commitment to the communities in which we do business and we consider responsible administration and payment of taxes as an obligation of doing business.
Download UK tax strategy
Our overall tax strategy is to:
Pay the right amount of tax, in the right jurisdiction and at the right time, in accordance with applicable laws
Consider tax in major business decisions as well as in the context of our reputation and brand
Develop and comply with appropriate tax risk processes and ensure Board oversight with respect to such processes and compliance
Above all, our UK tax strategy reflects the honesty and fairness that are a part of the Markel Style.
Our attitude towards tax planning
We seek to deliver long-term economic growth value to the shareholders of our parent company while complying fully with applicable tax laws and regulations that apply in all the territories in which we operate. In our view Markel Group shareholders would expect no less.
While we undertake tax planning as part of our overall business strategy we do not enter into abusive tax planning transactions nor do we engage in transactions that have no commercial rationale in order to obtain a tax benefit. From time to time we may undertake transactions that have a clear commercial rationale and that also produce a beneficial tax outcome. In those circumstances we take into account both the letter of the law and the intent of the law seeking counsel from external experts where appropriate to ensure that our interpretation of the law is reasonable and consistent with market practices.
Our tax risk appetite
Our tax arrangements are based on commercial business and economic activities. We rarely undertake transactions or employ tax planning strategies that do not have a clear and certain tax outcome. When such circumstances do arise we seek professional opinions and tax advice from independent external advisors to provide comfort that the tax outcome is more likely than not to be correct. Where appropriate we seek to engage with tax authorities to disclose and resolve tax issues, risks, and uncertain tax positions.
Our approach to tax risk management and governance
As taxation is a key component of meeting our wider business objectives we believe that tax risk should be prudently managed. To that end we have established policies for the management and governance of tax risks and regularly review the processes and controls embedded in those policies. The governance of tax risk exposure is a matter for the respective Board(s) of Directors of International, Nephila, and AMF Bakery Systems (UK) Ltd to consider, and updates on taxation matters are provided to each by their respective finance directors. All members of Markel are required to comply with the Markel Group risk management framework and tax risk is reviewed periodically by their risk management or compliance function and on an ad-hoc basis by Internal Audit. Additionally we engage regularly with our external auditors to whom full and complete disclosures are made of all material taxation issues as part of their audit.
Our approach towards dealing with the taxation authorities
In keeping with the ethos of the Markel Style we seek to maintain open and honest relationships with HMRC and other taxation authorities in all the territories in which we operate, to treat them with the respect that we would in turn expect from them and to engage with them on a real-time basis on any matters of significance or concern. In the UK we regularly engage with HMRC through our UK Head of Tax to discuss our tax affairs, striving to address potential issues quickly and in a collaborative manner. In short, we endeavour to display respect, cooperation, and integrity in all our dealings with tax authorities.

North America producer compensation disclosure
These are exciting times at Markel. We continue to grow because of our great production partners. The Markel value proposition is reflected in our focus of building strong relationships with our partners, developing niche leading products, providing underwriting and claims expertise, as well as excellent service.
Markel Specialty underwrites property and casualty products for both standard and hard-to-place risks. Our primary product focus is on commercial and personal lines programs.
All of Markel’s contracted producers receive compensation for placing insurance with our admitted insurance company affiliates. Additional compensation may be offered to encourage producers to market and sell our products, and to maintain a volume of profitable business. An overview of Markel’s various compensation plans could include:
  Base commissions (contract commission schedule)
We generally pay producers a fixed commission for business placed with our admitted insurance company affiliates. Commissions are paid on new and renewal policies. This commission is usually a fixed percentage of the policy premium. The percentage varies dependent on line of business and products.
Contingent compensation (profit sharing and bonus commission plans)
Contingent compensation plans generally use specific goals, often in combination, to determine if a producer can qualify for additional compensation after meeting certain criteria. Goals may include, but are not limited to, profitability and volume as defined in the producer contract.
A producer may have separate contingent compensation plans with various programs and/or other Markel business units. We evaluate performance against pre-set goals annually. If the producer has met the goals, the payment amount can be a percentage of the earned premium a producer has placed with us for specific types of insurance.
Business production incentives
We can provide producers the opportunity to receive additional compensation for placing specific types of policies with us, helping us pursue new business opportunities with their customers such as book rolls or transfers, or performing additional marketing and advertising duties.
Additional producer incentives
Additional producer incentives could include sales promotions, where gift cards, prizes, or additional commissions are awarded to encourage submissions and placement of new and renewal business with Markel.
Please note, we may not pay all these types of compensation to a producer who places business with Markel. For questions on Markel’s producer compensation plans, please contact your Markel sales representative or underwriting contact.
  Rewards are not transferable to any policyholder. Markel Specialty Commercial's insurance products and services are offered through Markel Specialty, a business division of Markel Service Incorporated. Policies are written by one or more Markel insurance companies. Terms and conditions for rate and coverage may vary.

Unclaimed property
Disclaimer: this information pertains to US based payees and may not be applicable to non-US based payees.
What is unclaimed property?
Generally, unclaimed property means any abandoned or uncashed funds held by a company where the payee can no longer be reached. If you have received a courtesy or due diligence letter from us indicating that you have unclaimed property with Markel, please view the FAQs below for additional information. To view more information on state regulations around unclaimed property, please visit your state’s unclaimed property website.
Why have I received a letter regarding unclaimed property?
Markel regularly sends out letters in an attempt to locate owners of inactive or uncashed checks. Once checks reach the time that they are 4-6 months old, a courtesy letter is sent to all payees with outstanding checks. Courtesy letters are sent in addition to the applicable state required due diligence letters which we send out approximately 3-6 months before applicable state filing deadlines. We make diligent efforts to try to contact our payees to make sure any outstanding checks get to the intended payee.
If you have received a correspondence from us regarding unclaimed property, it means that our records have indicated we have a liability owed to you. We are required by applicable state laws to attempt to make contact with any person or business that we owe funds to (e.g. an uncashed check). Ultimately, if we cannot contact the payee or owner of the funds to reissue the check, the funds will be sent to the state of the owner’s last known address.
What are the next steps for me to claim my funds from Markel?
If you have received a letter from us and wish to have your funds reissued to you, the next step is to complete the bottom portion of the letter, check the “Please reissue check to below address”, and return it to us via email, fax, or mail.
However, if you believe that the funds are no longer due, please return the letter with the check box indicating that the funds are no longer due.
Email: RegDisbRequests@Markel.com
Fax: (402) 505-4893
Mail: 4521 Highwoods Parkway, Glen Allen, VA 23060
I do not recognize the name Markel. What are these funds from?
Markel Group Inc. is a financial holding company that includes a group of affiliated insurance companies. Usually, uncashed checks are the result of insurance losses, settlements, or insurance premium refunds due to a change or cancellation of a policy with one of the Markel Group insurance companies.
The Markel Group U.S. insurance companies includes, but is not limited to, the following: Markel Global Reinsurance Company, Essentia Insurance Company (insurance plans administered by “Hagerty”), Evanston Insurance Company, FirstComp Insurance Company, Markel American Insurance Company, Markel Insurance Company, State National Companies, Inc. State National Insurance Company, Inc., SureTec Insurance Company, and T.B.A. Insurance Group, Ltd..
I have the check in my possession but I have been holding it until service or repairs are completed before I cash it. What should I do with the check? Can I continue to hang onto it until work is complete?
If you receive a courtesy letter from us regarding an uncashed check and you are still holding that check because you are waiting for vehicle or other repairs or services to be completed, you should consider setting those funds aside in a savings account. Holding onto a check can result in the check becoming stale and no longer valid. We recommend cashing and depositing the funds rather than holding on to the physical check.
I need to change the payee name on the original check due to the death of the beneficiary or the closure of a business. What do I need to do and what documentation is needed?
If the beneficiary name for a check payment needs to be altered, legal documentation will be required.
Death of a beneficiary: please send an email to RegDisbRequests@markel.com with the completed letter and indicate that the beneficiary of the funds needs to be changed. We can reissue the check to “The Estate of…” with the following documentation:
A completed unclaimed property letter
An official copy of the death certificate
If you need additional information concerning the probate process in general, we recommend reaching out to a private attorney.
Closure of a business: please send an email to RegDisbRequests@markel.com with the completed letter and indicate that the beneficiary of the funds needs to be changed. Additional documentation needed is:
A completed unclaimed property letter
A Certificate of Dissolution for the business from the state/county where your business was originally registered specifying how final monies are to be handled
The letter I received is from the State of California, not Markel. How do I proceed in order to claim funds?
The State of California sends out their own due diligence letters based on preliminary filing information that we are required to send to the state. To claims funds related to a letter sent from the State of California, you can proceed by writing on the letter received. Specifically, on the letter, write:
“Replacement check needed” If you believe the funds are not due to you, please complete these same steps but write “Funds are not due to me”.
A current address, phone number and/or email address
Sign, date & print your name
Send the letter, a scanned copy or picture of this letter to Markel via:

Email: RegDisbRequests@Markel.com
Fax: (402) 505-4893
Mail: 4521 Highwoods Parkway, Glen Allen, VA 23060
Why do you require personal information such as address and phone number?
Unclaimed property is subject to audit by applicable state government agencies. In an audit, we are required to demonstrate that we took appropriate steps to return property to the rightful owner and require the completed letter for our audit record-keeping purposes. Further, address updates may be needed to reissue the check to the correct location and phone and/or email contact information may be needed in case we have additional questions or otherwise need to make contact.
I submitted the letter requesting a check reissue. How long will I need to wait to receive it?
Once we have received your completed letter, we strive to make sure you receive the reissued check within 6 to 8 business weeks. If you have not received your check or would like an update on the status, you can contact us by phone (804) 565-1913 or by email at RegDisbRequests@Markel.com.
I received or returned the letter more than 30 days after the date on the letter, is it too late?
Not necessarily! We send out courtesy letters well in advance of the applicable state remittance deadline and due diligence letters more than 30 days before the applicable state filing deadlines. The 30 day deadline is to designed to encourage a response and make sure we have sufficient time to reissue your check. If the check has been remitted to the state, we will reach out to notify you and provide next steps to claim it.
How do I find out if I have additional unclaimed property?
It is possible that you may have additional unclaimed property being held by the state that you currently reside in or the state of a previous residence. To check for additional properties, simply log onto that state’s website and search by your name or business name.
What if I have additional questions not answered here?
Please feel free to contact us at any time via email at RegDisbRequests@markel.com or by phone at (804) 565-1913. When leaving a message, please make sure to include your name, the check number (if known) or check amount, a phone number, and any other relevant information.

  At Markel, we put people first.

Our passion lies in finding creative solutions for complex risks, and we leverage our most important asset—the power of our people—to create tailored coverage solutions that meet even the most intricate needs.
Making history

Since our inception, we’ve sought out the most innovative partners and embraced calculated risks. Our journey began with insuring jitney buses when no one else would, and over the past 90+ years we’ve evolved to support more people in more places. But it’s always been our people, with their deep industry experience and support from agile leadership, who truly set us apart worldwide.
Markel at a glance

Forming the insurance arm of the Markel Group, we proudly manage Markel Specialty, Markel International and Markel Global Reinsurance, as well as State National, which manages portfolio protection and program services, and Nephila, our insurance-linked securities operations.
Your success is our priority, and we strive to be a long-term committed partner to you—our colleagues, brokers and clients—and win together.

Since the very start, we’ve used our vast array of tools and knowledge to put people first.

Modern slavery statement
Markel International - slavery and human trafficking statement for financial year 2023
Markel International Holdings Limited and its subsidiary undertakings (as defined in s.1162 Companies Act 2006) together is the “Markel International Group”. We are an international insurance group which looks after the commercial insurance needs of major businesses, SMEs, professionals and sole traders. We underwrite risks in our syndicate at Lloyd’s, and in the London insurance company market. Markel Protection Limited provides legal and professional fees insurance cover as well as legal, tax and human resources consultancy.
We have over 1,494 employees and operate in 13 countries. We are a part of the Markel Group, and our ultimate parent company, Markel Group Inc., is listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
This statement is made pursuant to Section 54, Part 6 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 on behalf of the following companies for the financial year ending 31 December 2023:
• Markel International Insurance Company Limited
• Markel International Services Limited
• Markel Capital Limited
This statement sets out the steps the above companies have taken to ensure that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in our supply chains or in any part of our business.
MARKEL'S CODE OF CONDUCT
The Markel Style sets forth our core values and principles, the way we want to do business. Quoting from the Markel Style, “Our creed is honesty and fairness in all our dealings… We respect our relationships with our suppliers and have a commitment to our communities.”
We have a Code of Conduct because companies with strong ethical cultures have a strong foundation for success. Vendors, customers and shareholders can rely on them to do the right thing. The Code of Conduct reminds Markel Associates how Markel conducts business and how we work with each other and our partners. A certification of compliance with the Code of Conduct is required from all our employees and directors. All employees sign up to the Code of Conduct and it is a core element in living the Markel Style. A culture of openness within the Markel International Group is encouraged where employees can raise concerns over unethical, illegal or dangerous practices, including slavery or human trafficking, under Markel International’s whistleblowing policy.
Our business
Markel International has appropriate controls in place to ensure that the risk of slavery and human trafficking in our business is very low.
Our supply chains
Markel International’s supply chains are relatively short as a financial and professional services group. We do use routine services for the maintenance and support of our office operations in the UK, Europe, Asia Pacific, the Middle East and the Americas, such as cleaning and technical support services for such things as air conditioning, IT, telephones and communications infrastructure. We do not act as a producer, manufacturer or retailer of physical goods and have no supply chain in relation to such activities.
Our approach to mitigating slavery and human trafficking in our supply chain
As part of our initiative to identify and mitigate risk we have mapped our suppliers and performed a risk assessment to identify those with a higher risk of modern slavery in their business or supply chain. Where necessary, we have written to those higher-risk suppliers asking them to confirm (a) that they have considered the risk of modern slavery in their business and supply chain, and (b) that they are satisfied there is none. The majority of suppliers contacted have now responded with such confirmation or an adequate modern slavery statement of their own and any outstanding responses are chased. 
To ensure an appropriate level of understanding of the risks of modern slavery and human trafficking in our supply chains, training is provided to staff as relevant.
All Markel International Group’s standard contracts contain a clause requiring compliance with all applicable laws, which include the Modern Slavery Act 2015.
This statement was approved by the Board of Markel International Holdings Limited.
