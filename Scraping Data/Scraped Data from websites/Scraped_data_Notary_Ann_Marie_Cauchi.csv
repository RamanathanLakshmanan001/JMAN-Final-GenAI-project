Buyingand Selling
Last updated date: 02.09.2014
Immovable property in Malta
When a prospective buyer identifies the immovable property to be purchased, he/she enters into a written agreement (promise of sale agreement) with the Seller, containing the details of all the parties, a detailed description of the property, the price, the validity period of the agreement and any other terms and conditions agreed upon between the parties.

On meeting to sign a promise of sale agreement the parties must provide the following:-
The Seller:
Identity card, passport, or any other official document for personal identification
A copy of the contract of purchase showing how the property being sold was acquired - NB if the property in question derived from an inheritance, details also needed are date of death of the deceased from whom the testamentary disposition originated as well as copy of the latter's last valid will and the deed of declaration of transmission causa mortis.
A block plan showing the immovable in question together with the property's building permit.
If the immovable was acquired during marriage both spouses need to be parties to the transfer and their date of marriage is also requisite.
If a seller is abroad or cannot for other reasons valid be present when the transfer takes place, a power of attorney is necessary to carry the process forthwith - NB in the event that the seller is residing in a country other than Malta, such person's tax registration number becomes a requisite. Where such person isn't registered in Malta, the steps necessary to register such person in Malta are effected.
In the case of a company, a copy of its Memorandum and Articles of Association or Resolution of the Board of Directors enabling such person to represent such company is needed.
The Buyer:
Identity card, passport, or any other official document for personal identification
Cheque book to pay deposit to seller where applicable
Payment of 1% of the purchase price on account of Duty on Documents.
Once the Promise of sale agreement is duly signed and registered the following steps must be followed:-
The Seller:
It is important to ascertain, prior the final contract, that any pending bills for electricity, ground rent, water, telephone or television/cable have been paid. Receipts are to be presented at the drawing of the final deed.
Provide the Notary with any additional information or documents he may have requested (for instance for the detailed plans for the purposes of the land registry, any wills or death certificates, letters cancelling hypothecs from banks, documents for the purposes of tax computation etc.) in the shortest time practicable.
The Buyer:
In the event of taking a loan from a financial institution, it is important that such application is followed through to ensure the fastest route is taken in getting the loan approved and issuing of the necessary sanction letter. During the same period a plan and site plan of the property on Land Registry stationery needs to be provided and handed over to the Notary so that an official search at the Land Registry may be effected. In the meantime, the Buyer should also ensure that the House and Life insurance policies requested by the Bank are in place and paid up and the relative pledge forms in favour of the Bank duly signed.
What Happens Prior to signing of the Final Contract?
It is in this transitory time between signing of promise of sale and the final contract that the notary is engaged with all necessary verifications and preparations that will in turn enable the final contract to be made.

If the parties so wish, the Notary orders searches to ascertain that the seller has good title and can proceed with the sale without being impeded by legal niceties.

Where the seller is either non Maltese or not resident in Malta the Notary is bound to obtain for such seller a tax clearance from the Department of Tax before proceeding with the final contract.

In the instance of foreign buyers, there needs to be issued a special permit for such purpose issued by the Minister of Finance.
Where the immovable was inherited prior 24th November 1992, a permit from the Department of Succession Duty must be obtained unless 20 years have elapsed from the date of death of the deceased.

If the buyer is going to take a loan from a commercial bank, the Notary has to present all relevant documents to the Bank's legal office for vetting prior to the final contract.

Where the immovable to be sold has attached to it any hypothec, where such property serves as a guarantee for some banking facility taken by the seller, the Notary needs to make the arrangements necessary for the cancellation of such hypothec.
When meeting to sign the Final Deed of Sale the parties must provide the following:-
The Seller:
Identity card, passport, or any other official document for personal identification
Copy of last receipts of payment due in view of ground rent, electricity/water bills etc. - NB in order to register water and electricity metres under buyer's name a special form is required containing the readings for such meters to be obtained from either the Water Services Corporation or the Local Council.
Any other document (such as plans, permits, cancellation of hypothecs, etc.) asked for by the Notary.
If for some reason the parties appearing on the promise of sale cannot all be present for the final contract, a power of attorney is required.
The tax registration number of the seller if resident outside Malta
In the case of a company, a copy of the Memorandum and Articles of association or resolution of the board of directors authorising such person to represent the company.
All keys of the property being sold.
The Buyer:
Identity card, passport, or any other official document for personal identification
Cheque book in order to pay the balance on the final consideration, the duty on documents, as well as the dues for the act and notarial fees.
What happens after signing the final deed?
After the final contract has been duly signed, the Notary has 15 days within which to i) pay the tax collected on such contract, ii) enrol the deed in the Malta Public Registry or the Gozo Public Registry, and in the Land Registry, where applicable.

Concurrently, the Notary would compile the Register (first copy) of the Original Act and sends authenticated copies to all the involved parties.

Finally, the Notary collates all the original contracts published in that calendar year and makes an index for the same, binds them in volumes and then passes them onto the Visitor of the Court of Magistrates for them to be inspected accordingly archived under the auspices of the Notary to Government. The register (first copy) of each Act is retained by the Notary after it has been duly collated with the original.
Disclaimer: While the Notarial Council endeavours to present the most current information, please consult a notary, legal or tax professional for legal advice.

The Officeof the Notary Public
Certainty, Impartiality, Independence.
The office of the Notary Public is characterized primarily by an element of public faith and public trust - both intrinsic elements of the Profession, hinged on impartiality and independence.

The rigorous professional selection and preparation with which Notaries are trained ascertains that the general public can rest safe in the knowledge that the members of the Profession are all governed by common strict principles and legal knowledge.

The Law in fact poses on the Notary the onerous obligation to ascertain the will of the parties and to put it in the legal format most akin to the desired outcome, thus avoiding costly misinterpretation, uncertainty and ultimately, litigation.

The Notary Public is responsible, and indeed is the ultimate guarantor for, the authenticity and truthfulness of the acts executed by the parties in his presence. Through the Notarial Profession the citizen has the certainty that most Civil matters that fall within the ambit of the Profession, will be dealt expeditiously and efficiently.

The Notary is a Public Officer and as such is an emanation of the State. At the same time he is a free professional with his own personal office, independent of the State and of the parties. This dual-nature ensures the right balance between the legal-fiscal functions for which the Notary is the ultimate reference point.

Conveyancing (property sales, purchase, leasing, etc), financing collateral (hypothecation of immovables), succession (wills, trusts, etc) and matters pertaining to civil status (matrimonial regimes, personal separations, etc) are all within the ambit of the Profession and form the portfolio of a Notary's day-to-day work. It is only through a Notarial act that most transactions related to the above are given legal effect and this adds certainty and improves efficiency. Being a necessary passage at Law, the Notarial requirement makes for a very cost-effective way of crystallizing a state of certainty in that Notarial tariffs are stipulated by Law and the Citizen is all the more protected. The Notarial intervention is thus imposed by Law to safeguard legality and ensuring at all times that the autonomy of the private citizen never goes beyond what is legally and statutorily permitted.

The Notary, therefore, can be seen as the beacon of legal certainty and security in the most crucial milestones of a private Citizen's life, with regards to the the acquiring of property during one's lifetime or following the death of a relative, business financing, marriage or estate planning, and of course where the regulation of one's succession is involved through wills and the Notary's intervaention ensures fair and impartial solutions, which protect all the parties concerned, thus avoiding painful misunderstandings and costly litigation.

Obligationsof the Notary
Duties and Responsibilities of the Notary
The Notary publishing a contract is primarily bound by the Notarial Professions and Notarial Archives Act, Chapter 55 of the laws of Malta for:-

Ascertaining the identity of the parties and their capacity to contract
Ordaining of the contract adhering in the best way to the legal form in order to reach the objectives of the contracting parties
Registering any note by law required emanating from the same contract, in the Public and Land Registries where required and within the stipulated time
Archiving and registering of the original Act
As well as for the collection and payment of any dues and taxes pending in consideration of the said Act.
The Notary as a Public Officer also has the obligation to be impartial and safeguard the best interests of all the parties to a deed.

In the case where the parties request of the Notary searches (active and passive) to be carried out on the property concerned and any debts it may be burdened with, the Notary orders such searches from the relevant Government Department, and if so requested by the parties the Notary can thus proceed in ascertaining whether or not the seller has a good title on the said property, and whether the same is burdened by debts.

At no time is the Notary to be held responsible for the contents of such search, which are effectively authenticated by the Director of the Public Registry. The Notary bases his thesis of root of title on these official searches which he would have ordered diligently but did not himself personally carry out. The Notary interprets and expounds on the collected information with the diligence of him required by law in order to reach a conclusion on such root of title.

Therefore, a Notary is not responsible for the following:-
Missing Information or Notes which do not result from Official Searches
Any entry in the public registry which can not be captured by an updated official search at least 21 days prior to a Notarial deed
Knowledge about any Cases pending before the Courts or before arbitration boards or tribunals regarding either the property or the parties
Any Government registration which result from a registration of property resulting from the Church-State Agreement governed by Chapter 358 of the Laws of Malta and its annexes, not registered in the Land Registry
Building permits, irregularities regarding the latter and pending issues with MEPA
Requisition Orders and/or expropriation Orders
Personal rights on the property such as rents, which don't transpire from the official searches
Services and payments pending on the property such as ground rent arrears, water and electricity services rental and consumption, telephone, cable television and any other services.
In the case where the property derives from any intestate succession, if there exist other heirs other than those acting or who acted as such.
In the case of schedules of deposits and redemptions of ground rent, if the said schedule or redemption was made against the correct persons.

The PropertyTitle Report
Last updated date: 25.07.2014
From the 1st January 2013, when the Notary examines the title to a property, the Notary is obliged to prepare a Report and give it to the buyer on the signing of the contract, for a fee agreed to between the buyer and the Notary.

Before 2013 the law did not establish what searches should be carried out by the Notary. This left the buyer in a situation of uncertainty and therefore the law was changed to protect the buyer.

Today the law assumes that the Notary signing a contract of sale/purchase has examined the searches on behalf of the buyer. In order to protect the buyer, the law also stipulates that after the Notary has checked all the searches, the Notary must prepare a Report in writing and give it to the buyer. In fact, the Report must contain a list of searches examined by the Notary and if the Notary has any reservations about the searches, these must be mentioned in the Report to enable the buyer to obtain advice before taking a decision.

There are situations in which the Notary is automatically exempt by law from examining searches, for example certain donations and redemption of groundrent (fidi ta’ ċens). In all other cases, the Notary must always provide the Report to the buyer unless the buyer instructs the Notary not to carry out any searches whatsoever.

To ensure that the buyer is safeguarded, the law does not allow the Notary to check the searches without preparing the Report. It is only through the Report that the buyer can establish whether the Notary has examined the searches required by law. If the Notary does not provide the Report on the signing of the contract, the contract will contain a declaration stating that the Notary has not checked any searches and is not responsible towards the buyer.

Once the Report is given to the buyer, the Notary also has an obligation to keep the searches for 5 years.

Disclaimer: While the Notarial Council endeavours to present the most current information, please consult a notary, legal or tax professional for legal advice.

TaxInformation
Last updated date: 13.03.2015
On acquiring and disposing of immovable property in Malta, any person, whether juridical or physical, is subject to taxation according to the Duty on Documents and Transfers Act, Chapter 364 of the Laws of Malta and the Income Tax Management Act, Chapter 372 of the Laws of Malta and the Income Tax Act, Chapter 123 of the Laws of Malta.

The Buyer
5% Duty on Documents calculated on the purchase price of the immovable property
If the Buyer is a European Union Citizen declaring on deed that he shall reside in the property being purchased as his sole ordinary residence, then the preferential rate of 3.5% is applied on the first €150,000 of the price.
In respect of transfers of immovable property, made on or after the 5th November 2013 but before the 1st July 2015, no duty shall be chargeable on the first €150,000 of the aggregate value of the consideration paid for the acquisition of such property, provided that this is the first immovable property acquired inter vivos by such person.


The Seller:
What is the new rate of the final withholding tax on property and from when is it effective?
With effect from 1st January, 2015 the current system consisting of both a 12% final withholding tax on the transfer value and 35% tax on the profit or gain will be replaced by one final withholding tax of 8% on the value of the property transferred.
Are there any exceptions?
How will the new final withholding tax system apply in the case of property transferred on or after 1st January, 2015 where a notice of a promise of sale or transfer relating to that property had been given to the Commissioner before the 17th November, 2014?
If a promise of sale or transfer relating to a property that forms part of a project or of property situated within a special designated area given to the Commissioner before the 17th November, 2014 is cancelled after this date or expires, and such transfer would have been subject to 12% final withholding tax if the transfer was made before the 1st January 2015, will an eventual transfer be taxed under the new system if made on or after the 1st January 2015 i.e. at a lower rate of 8% or 10%?
Will it be possible to elect to exclude a transfer property from the scope of the final withholding tax system on or after the 1st January 2015?
What happens in the case of transfers made on or after the 1st January, 2015 of property that forms part of a project or of property situated within a special designated area?
Where a transfer of property is made by a person who is not resident in Malta and who is resident for tax purposes in another country, such person may currently opt out of the 12% final withholding tax system. Will this remain the same under the new system?
Are there any circumstances where an election may still be made to exclude the transfer from final withholding tax system and elect to be taxed on the profit or gain?
Do the exemptions prescribed under article 5A(4) of the Income Tax Act still apply?
Which date is to be taken as the date of acquisition where the transferor is a company that had acquired the property by means of a transfer that qualified for the intra-group exemption?
How am I taxed if I inherited the property after the 24th November, 1992?
How am I taxed if the property was inherited before the 25th November 1992?
How am I taxed if I acquired the property by donation?
How am I taxed if I sell the property on or after the 1st January, 2015 in the circumstances referred to in article 31C(1) of the Income Tax Act?
How am I taxed in the case of an assignment of a right obtained in terms of a promise of sale (konvenju)?
Can I deduct brokerage fees from the value of the property transferred, before applying the final withholding tax?

Acquisition of Immovable Property
What is the procedure to purchase immovable property in Malta?
Acquisition by Individuals
Citizens of all European Union member states, including Maltese Citizens, who have resided in Malta continuously for a minimum period of five years at any time preceding the date of acquisition may freely acquire immovable property without the necessity of obtaining a permit under Chapter 246 of the Laws of Malta.

Citizens of all European Union member states, including Maltese Citizens, who have not resided continuously in Malta for a minimum period of five years may only purchase their primary residence or any immovable property required for their business activities or supply of services without the necessity of obtaining a permit under Chapter 246 of the Laws of Malta.

Citizens of all European Union member states, including Maltese Citizens, who have not resided continuously in Malta for a minimum period of five years, require a permit under Chapter 246 of the Laws of Malta to acquire immovable property for secondary residence purposes.
Individuals who are not citizens of a European Member state may not acquire any immovable property unless they are granted an acquisition permit (AIP) in terms of Chapter 246 of the Laws of Malta.

There are defined zones in Mata, referred to as special designated areas, where there are absolutely no restrictions to acquisition - the s-called Special Designated Areas. There is also no restriction on acquisition through inheritance and there are also several other special exemptions. Different rules apply to the acquisition by Companies and other legal persons (bodies of persons).
Acquisition by Companies and other Legal Persons:
A body of persons, other than a commercial partnership, established in and operating from an European Union member state may freely acquire immovable property that is required for the purpose for which it has been set up as long as it is directly controlled by citizens of a European Union member state who have resided in Malta continuously for five years.

A commercial partnership established in and operating from an European Union member state (therefore including Malta) may freely acquire immovable property that is required for the purpose for which it has been set up and at least 75% of its share capital is held by a person (or persons) who is a European Union Member state citizen.

Any other body of persons will require a permit (AIP) which is only granted if the property is required for an industrial or touristic project or as a contributor to the development of the economy of Malta.

When the prospective buyer identifies the immovable property to be purchased, he/she enters into a written agreement (promise of sale agreement), a copy of which must be attached to the AIP application form obtainable from the Capital Transfer Duty Department of the Inland Revenue Division or downloaded from the Ministry's website.

Succession
Last updated date: 08.08.2015
Why draw up a Will?
Any person acquiring any rights over a property will be subjected to the laws of that particular country, with regard to that particular immovable. Therefore, any formalities required by the Laws of the foreign country will have to be followed, before any person may acquire immovable property in any particular country. Hence, it is advisable for any person owning immovable property in any particular country, to regulate one's estate within that particular territory by a will drawn up in conformity with the local Laws. In absence of any such legally binding document, the property, upon his demise, would be disposed of according to Law, which would vary from country to country. This scenario will change somewhat with the coming into force of Regulation (EU) 650 of 2012 on 17th August, 2015, regulating cross-border succession. The regulation introduces a single connecting factor, the law of the last habitual residence of the deceased, in order to designate both the competent jurisdiction to rule on the whole of a succession and the law applicable to a succession. It also introduces the possibility to choose the law of one of the states whose nationality one possesses as the law applicable to one’s succession.
How is Succession regulated in Malta?

Customer Due Diligence Protocols & Anti-Money Laundering Obligations
At the outset of a new transaction the Notary will require some detailed information from all the parties which is either obligatory or deemed necessary for the proper discharge of particular obligations. In terms of Legal Notice 180/2008 the Notary is a Subject Person and is legally bound to ensure that proper Customer Due Diligence (CDD) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures are followed through.

Identification and Verification
The Law requires Notaries to obtain satisfactory evidence of the identity of the parties and sometimes people related to them. This is because particular transactions involving a Notary may be used as a vehicle by criminals in order to legitimise their illicit gains. In this regard, the Notary will ask for evidence of your identity as soon as possible upon your first meeting and will make copies of certain documents for identification purposes. It is therefore important to present yourself with an identification document (identity card, passport, driving licence, etc). The Notary may also require a confirmation of your permanent residence by means of additional documentation, such as a recent utility bill.

Remittance of Funds
It is strongly advised that all funds transferred to the Notary’s designated account are made either through personal internet banking, a SWIFT transfer or a Bankers’ Draft. Personal cheques will be accepted at the Notary’s discretion. Some information about the source of such funds is required and the Notary may ask for any documentary evidence deemed necessary. Should any part of a payment be made by a third party (a relative, a partner, etc) the Notary is required to carry out the same procedures on him or her.

Forms and Documentation
The Notary is obliged by Law to keep a record of the procedures undertaken and will thus hand out specific forms to be filled in by all the parties in order to collect as much information as possible at one go. The Notary may also require any additional information or documentation deemed necessary in the context of the particular transaction. All the information and documentation obtained in the course of the discharge of these obligations is striclty confidential.

It is important to note that notwithstanding any engagement instructions, the Notary can reserve the right not to provide the services required if any requirements are not satisfactorily met by the information and assistance supplied.
