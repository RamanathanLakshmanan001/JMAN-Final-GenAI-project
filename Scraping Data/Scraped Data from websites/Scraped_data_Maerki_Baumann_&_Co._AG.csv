Die 1932 gegründete Privatbank Maerki Baumann & Co. AG mit Sitz in Zürich konzentriert sich auf ihre Kernkompetenzen in der Anlageberatung und Vermögensverwaltung sowie in der Betreuung unabhängiger Vermögensverwalter. Das für moderne Technologien aufgeschlossene Traditionshaus differenziert sich als langfristig orientiertes Familienunternehmen, das seine Dienstleistungen ausschliesslich aus der Schweiz heraus anbietet.
