Bringing LWM and FASCOLUX together and rebrand it into INDUNA enables us to provide even more services (fund administration services, family steward…) in more strategically important solutions and jurisdictions.
We remain confident and committed to delivering on our promise to be “Your global boutique trust company”.
We are passionate about what we do and strive to deliver an excellent service to our clients. Working together with the best Luxembourg advisors, we have been recognised as being a highly reliable partner.
We have 30+ years of experience in servicing the most demanding clients and have gone through all steps of service delivery together with complementary service providers.
We operate a ‘boutique’ trust company and work closely together with the client and their advisor to help deliver tailor made solutions that meet your trust and/or corporate needs.
INDUNA’s team has been with us for over 15 years in average and the partners are personally involved in the client relationships.
There are two other client relationship managers involved and they will always be aware about the issues going on in the company enabling the clients to always get a prompt assistance and feedback.
