MAINFIRST is an independent European multi-investment boutique with an active management approach. The company manages its own mutual as well as special funds in the following asset classes: equities, bonds, and multi-asset.

This approach, combined with an authentic corporate culture, provides the optimal basis for generating alpha and creating long-term value for our investors. Sustainability aspects are explicitly incorporated into all MainFirst funds and are fully integrated into the decision-making process for active security selection. In this way, the company combines the expertise and flexibility of focused investment teams with the strengths and clearly defined processes of a broad-based international platform.

SUSTAINABLE INVESTMENTS (ESG)
When we hear the word “value”, we don’t just think of financial value, but also of ethical values. The concepts are two sides of the same coin. After all, you have to adopt a forward-looking, conscientious approach if you want to achieve above-average returns in the long term. Our experience shows that investors who take environment, social and governance aspects into account when making decisions fare better in the long term. This is how responsible investment pays off – in every sense of the world."

FUND TEAMS
MainFirst teams are made up of top-class specialists. While others restrict themselves to a benchmark-based approach of tracking popular indices, we opt for individual, actively managed investment strategies. Our portfolio managers have the knowledge, perseverance, determination and experience they need to achieve our common goal: better performance. Keeping a constant eye on positive alpha (excess return), our fund managers act like entrepreneurs, making clear recommendations and only investing in those individual stocks that they are absolutely sure about. This sort of approach calls for prudence, courage and a goal-driven mindset – lateral thinking that translates into straightforward action. That’s how we manage assets with character."

MEGATRENDS ASIA
The MEGATRENDS of tomorrow are emerging in the Far East. Invest specifically and sustainably in Asian topics of the future with MainFirst Megatrends Asia. The theme-based approach focuses on investment themes linked to the opportunity for structural growth - such as digitalization, robots, automation, semiconductors, electric cars, batteries and renewable energies. Invested exclusively in Asia, the fund’s stock selection is carried out via bottom-up analyses, i.e. on the basis of detailed company analyses. In its strategy, the fund follows a growth approach without regional or sectoral specifications. It favours companies that benefit from long-term structural growth.

INVESTOR PROFILE
BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT SERVICES
We want to offer our clients the best possible investment solution. But what really is the best possible investment solution? Not every fund is suitable for every investor. This means that the solution has to be tailored to suit the investor’s individual risk profile and specific objectives. This analysis and decision-making process – from the consultation session to purchase – is handled by FENTHUM, our Business Development Services-Partner. They use their expertise and experience to ensure that the investor portfolio is tailor-made – the basis for long-term success."
