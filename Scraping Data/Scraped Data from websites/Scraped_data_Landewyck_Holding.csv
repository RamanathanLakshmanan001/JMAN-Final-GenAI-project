If the processing of your personal data was/is conducted in an unlawful manner, you have the option to demand the restriction of the processing of your data instead of demanding the erasure of this data; or

WHY LANDEWYCK?
EVERYTHING YOU ALWAYS WANTED
INDEPENDENT FAMILY BUSINESS
In the year 1847, Josephine van Landewyck and Jean-Pierre Heintz established a tobacconist shop in Luxembourg. Over the years, the business of yore grew to become Landewyck Tobacco – one of the most respected 100% family-owned, independent tobacco manufacturers in the world today.
EXCLUSIVELY LOCAL EUROPEAN PRODUCTION
We manufacture tobacco and cigarettes ourselves exclusively in Western Europe, and attach great importance to maintaining the highest manufacturing, working and product standards that are socially acceptable to our consumers, partners and importers worldwide.
OVER 170 YEARS OF TOBACCO EXPERTISE
Our master tobacco blenders travel to the farthest reaches of the globe to hand-select the best leaves. Hence ensuring the unique flavour of our tobacco products – and all so our customers can enjoy the ultimate in smoking pleasure.
QUALITY AND RESPONSIBILITY
From ISO-certified product and manufacturing standards, from employees to retailers, we always ensure that our business decisions and the products we supply are in keeping with our family spirit – by upholding our tradition of delivering 100% quality, flavour and customer satisfaction.
ALWAYS A LITTLE DIFFERENT
What sets us apart and drives us is our passion. We want to engender genuine moments of pleasure in our consumers, and in pursuit of this goal, seek to develop the perfect flavour for each taste. This is an art that goes beyond the ability to simply manufacture high-quality tobaccos. We take the time to craft specific products that are perfectly tuned to the differing tastes around the world – tobacco products that cater to the lifestyles and desires of discerning consumers.

FIRST RETAIL SHOP OF THE FAMILY BUSINESS
When Jean-Pierre Heintz, at the age of 25, opened his first tobacco factory with a shop in Neutorstraße No. 9 in July 1847, it was the beginning of a success story. Early that year, he married nineteen-year-old Josephine Van Landewyck. Since Dutch tobacco enjoyed an excellent reputation, Jean-Pierre put his name and that of his wife on the company’s nameplate.
