JICO’s Story
In 1975, a group of shrewd forward-thinking entrepreneurs joined forces to insure their own respective companies specializing in finance, import-export trading, and pharmaceuticals. Recognizing a gap in the Jordan market, the three founders established JICO. It has since become one of the leading insurance pioneers in the Kingdom, offering comprehensive life insurance and specialized solutions for individuals, families, and businesses across the country through a wide network of branches.
JICO’s robust financial growth has enabled the company to invest strategically in infrastructure, customer support, innovation, and digital development, providing simplified and seamless experiences to clients anytime, anywhere. JICO’s commitment to continuous improvement ensures that we remain at the forefront of the insurance industry.

Getting travel insurance in Jordan and visiting Jordan is as easy as ABC. Every year thousands of travelers suffer accidents, miss their flights, lose their luggage, and face cancellations or some unexpected event. As a result, these travelers end up losing hundreds of dollars just because they did not buy any travel insurance, which does not break the bank! Ultimately, travel insurance is about protecting you from any unforeseen complications or incidents. So, make sure to get the right insurance to feel secure and worry-free on your trips.
Your travel insurance mainly depends on the following three main factors:
Your age
Destination
Duration of stay
