Marcuard Heritage is committed to safeguarding the personal data that we collect from individuals who use this Website. Accordingly, Marcuard Heritage has developed this privacy & cookies statement to describe how and what type of data will be collected from users of the Website and the purposes for which Marcuard Heritage may collect, share, or disclose the data.
This privacy statement applies to any information obtained by Marcuard Heritage through your use of this Website.
3                 Processing of your personal data
When you visit Marcuard Heritage’s Website, our web server automatically records details about your visit (e.g. your IP address). Besides, we process personal data which you provide through the Website, for example when you enter personal details (e.g., name, gender, address, e-mail address, phone/fax number) on a contact form. We process your data for the technical administration of this Website, to address your requests submitted via a contact form and for such purposes as otherwise specified in this privacy & cookies statement.
Marcuard Heritage has implemented reasonable technical and organisational security measures to protect your personal data collected by us via this Website against unauthorised access, misuse, loss, or destruction. However, the internet is generally not regarded as a secure environment, and information sent via the internet may be accessed by unauthorised third parties, potentially leading to disclosures, changes in content or technical failures. Even if both sender and receiver are in the same country, information sent via the internet may be transmitted across borders and be forwarded to a country which may have a lower data protection level compared to the one in your country of residence.
Please note that we accept no responsibility or liability for the security of your information transmitted via the internet to the Website. To protect your privacy, we would like to remind you that you may also choose another channel of communication with Marcuard Heritage, which you deem is appropriate.

4                 How we collect your personal data (cookies)
Our Website uses cookies. Cookies are files that are automatically created by your browser and stored on your mobile device, computer or any other device when you visit a Website. Primarily, two cookie groups can be distinguished: technical cookies which enhance the functionality of the Website and cookies applied for reasons of user-friendliness. If you do not want cookie files to be stored on your device, you can adjust the settings of the respective browser in your device. However, in such a case, the functionality of the Website might be affected. The functional cookies do not store any information to identify the users of the Website. For further details on blocking of cookies, please check here.
Marcuard Heritage may store IP addresses for administrative purposes only, to resolve host and other server or technical problems connected to our system administrator. Such data is kept strictly confidential and following all applicable data protection law(s).
5                 Disclosure and sharing of your personal data
Marcuard Heritage may share your data within companies of the Marcuard Heritage Group or any of its affiliates, with external service providers, authorities for the purposes stated above, or in case legal, regulatory or market practice requires such. Therefore, the data may be transferred to third parties in Switzerland or abroad for the processing, storing, retention, printing, evaluation, or management of it. When transferring personal data internationally, we make sure that we comply with applicable laws and regulations. If a transfer of personal data is made to a third country that is not providing for an ‘adequate level of data protection’ or US-entities, which are not certified under the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) program , Marcuard Heritage ensures that such recipient of personal data will ensure that an ‘adequate level of data protection’ is provided. The latter will be safeguarded by concluding standard contractual clauses (SCC) that have been approved by the competent authority with the recipient of personal data and (if required) by taking appropriate measures to ensure that the recipient complies with them.
6                 Your rights
In accordance with and as far as provided by applicable law, you have the right to access, rectification, and erasure of your personal data, the right to restriction of processing or to object to our data processing, in particular for direct marketing purposes, for profiling carried out for direct marketing purposes and for other legitimate interests in processing in addition to right to receive certain personal data for transfer to another controller (data portability). In addition, every data subject has the right to enforce his/her rights in court or to lodge a complaint with the competent data protection authority. The competent data protection authority of Switzerland is the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner.
7                 Profiling and automated individual decision-making
Marcuard Heritage may partially process your personal data automatically with the aim of evaluating certain personal aspects (profiling). Profiling allows Marcuard Heritage to inform and advise you about products possibly relevant for you more accurately. For this purpose, Marcuard Heritage may use evaluation tools that enable us to communicate with you and advertise you as required, including market and opinion research.
In establishing and carrying out a business relationship, Marcuard Heritage generally does not use any fully automated individual decision making (such as pursuant to article 22 GDPR or article 21 FADP). Should Marcuard Heritage use such procedures in certain cases, Marcuard Heritage will inform you separately on this and advise you of your relevant rights if required by law.

This Website uses the service reCAPTCHA of Google LLC (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA; “Google”). The purpose of the query is to differentiate whether the input is made by a human being or by automated, machine processing. The query includes the sending of the IP address and any other data required by Google for the service reCAPTCHA to Google. For this purpose, your input will be transmitted to Google and used there. Your IP address will, however, be reduced by Google within member states of the European Union or in other signatory states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area before it is further used. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transferred to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. Google will not combine the IP address transmitted by your browser in the context of reCAPTCHA with other available data. By clicking on the query, you consent to the processing of your data. You may revoke your consent at any time without affecting the lawfulness of the processing carried out before revocation. Further information on Google reCAPTCHA and the corresponding data protection declaration is available here.
This privacy & cookies statement may be updated from time to time. Therefore, we kindly ask you to consult it regularly.

Our solutions cover the entire wealth planning spectrum – from companies, trusts and foundations to life insurance policies and private label funds.
Aimed at structuring and preserving your wealth, as well as preparing it for the next generation, we analyze your current situation, develop a strategy and then implement and manage that plan.

We believe in our people, and they believe in us, too. But don’t take our word for it. Hear what they have to say.
“It’s fascinating.”
Before coming to Marcuard Heritage, I didn’t have the opportunity to be involved in such a broad range of topics and work with such a wide variety of experts. It’s fascinating. I especially enjoy the close collaboration – as a team we can do so much to fully meet the needs of our clients.
 Peter Alder, COO l Head of Compliance, Switzerland. At Marcuard Heritage since 2012.
“More than just an employer.”
I have been able to grow and develop since my very first day at Marcuard Heritage because my colleagues have supported me both professionally and privately every step of the way. The trust they have placed in me and the independence I have make me feel valued. Marcuard Heritage is more than just an employer, it’s my family.
 Carolin Zesiger | Executive Assistant, Switzerland. At Marcuard Heritage since 2013.
“Marcuard Heritage is my home.”
The quality and depth of our service is something that impressed me from day one, not to mention the freedom to manage my clients and drive my own success. It’s just the right fit for me and I’m really proud to be a part of it. My colleagues are my friends. And Marcuard Heritage is my home.
 Michael Künzi | Managing Director, Switzerland. At Marcuard Heritage since 2013.
“My colleagues make the difference”
For me, it’s my colleagues who make the difference. From day one, I’ve felt part of a family – a unique group of people who inspire me each and every day of my professional journey.

The added bonus is working in an open environment based on trust and with colleagues as dedicated as I am.
 Michel Müller l Head of IT & Data Management, Switzerland. At Marcuard Heritage since 2015.
“A small and agile business model.”
Marcuard Heritage combines the best qualities of a small and agile business model with a professional corporate environment.

That is the ultimate motivator for me!
 Alexis Xenophontos l CEO of Marcuard Heritage (Europe) Ltd, Cyprus. At Marcuard Heritage since 2009.
“I wanted to escape the bureaucracy.”
I made a conscious decision to move to an independent company. I wanted to escape the bureaucracy associated with traditional banks. Marcuard Heritage has allowed me to tackle new challenges – for both our clients and our people. I’ve never been so motivated in my life.

Why work with us?
If you’re looking for a professional home built on solid principles and an independent model that drives you to excel, then you’ve come to the right place.
After many years working in the Swiss banking industry, our founders felt constrained by the traditional banking environment. They saw the fundamental strength of tying their success directly to their clients’ success and sought a fair approach to serving their clients – one deeply rooted in independence and integrity and focused entirely on their clients’ best interests.
This vision is alive and well at Marcuard Heritage today. Talented relationship managers with integrity and initiative will find their professional home here – along with a collaborative atmosphere reinforced by a flat organizational structure.
As a privately owned, independent company, we see ourselves as a team of entrepreneurs rather than employees. We work together to provide solutions and sound advice while respecting each other’s client relationships. Our straightforward revenue-sharing model drives us to perform at our best and in the client’s best interest. Our income grows alongside our client’s capital.
If you are experienced and passionate about what you do. If you are tired of bank bureaucracy and ready to take on new challenges. If you would like to take ownership of your client relationships – and share in your clients’ success – we want to hear from you.

At Marcuard Heritage, we believe that genuine relationships – relationships that last lifetimes and span generations – are what make the difference. That’s why we place a high value in trust, integrity and personal service as well as maintaining open and honest relationships with our clients.
This culture of closeness leads to an intimate understanding of our clients’ individual situations, family dynamics and long-term objectives and ultimately allows us to serve them better. And by offering bespoke services from a single source, with one point of contact, we create a level of continuity that provides peace of mind across generations.

Investment solutions
Whether you wish to delegate your investment decisions or play a more active role, we offer a best-in-class investment strategy and bespoke advisory services to meet your individual needs.
Today’s markets are highly unpredictable, which means your capital is constantly at risk. Regardless of this instability, you seek to mitigate your risk exposure and earn a consistently positive return over time. At Marcuard Heritage, we provide both discretionary portfolio management and investment advisory solutions designed to do just that.
We specialize in a hands-on absolute return strategy based on a discretionary mandate. As an asset manager, we combine best-in-class products and proactive risk management to create solutions aimed at avoiding sharp drawdowns and maintaining consistent, long-term growth. That means we are free to quickly modify asset allocations when significant market shifts occur. And with our success tied directly to yours, it’s in our own self-interest to always act in your best interest.
If you wish to make your own investment decisions, we serve as your trusted advisor. Based on your objectives, we leverage our decades of asset management experience and broad range of expertise to carefully evaluate options, assess risk and offer guidance.

Entrepreneurs from the very outset.
Marcuard Heritage began with a vision to build a wealth management company fully focused on the client’s best interest.
Marcuard Heritage AG was founded in 2003 by Sinan Bodmer, Adrian Guldener and Hans-Joerg Rudloff, three Swiss bankers with many years of experience in financial advising and building client relationships that span generations. They believed there was a better way to serve clients – one based on independence and integrity and focused entirely on their clients’ best interests.
The entrepreneurs broke away from the traditional bank model to start a wealth management company that allowed them to cultivate even closer ties with their clients and assemble the local and international expertise needed to meet their clients’ financial needs.
That entrepreneurial spirit has been a guiding light on our journey from then to now.
2003
Marcuard Heritage AG is founded in Zurich.
2010
Marcuard Heritage obtains regulatory licenses for offices in Cyprus and Singapore and acquires a stake in FF Marcuard, a wealth management company based in Lugano.
2014
Marcuard Heritage establishes Alpinum Investment Management AG in Zurich, an asset manager licensed by FINMA to manage investment funds.
2021
Marcuard Heritage AG was amongst the first portfolio managers to receive the FINMA license.
2024
Marcuard Heritage’s wealth protection investment strategy track record reaches 20 years +.
Marcuard Heritage (Middle East) Ltd. obtains ADGM license.

Our values
From the very beginning, we have been guided by a set of core principles that still shape our company today.
Independence. Integrity. Service.
Marcuard Heritage was built on the belief that through independence, integrity and personal service we could create a better approach to serving clients.
As wealth managers, we are not tied to any one bank and are therefore free to focus entirely on our clients’ best interests. We can cultivate close ties with them and assemble the local and international expertise needed to meet their financial needs.
At Marcuard Heritage, integrity is both a principle we live by and added value for our clients. Our relationships are open and honest and based on trust and mutual respect. We fully understand the individual needs and long-term objectives of our clients – and our clients are well aware of how we manage their wealth and how much they are paying for our services.
Our approach is personal. We live and work close to our clients. We know their culture and language. We are our clients’ one point of contact – their trusted advisor, making an entire career out of managing their wealth and preparing it for the next generation. This level of service simplifies our clients’ lives and provides continuity and peace of mind.
These core values have shaped our company for nearly two decades and will do so for many more to come.
Genuine relationships. Across generations.
We built our company on independence, integrity and the belief that genuine relationships have no expiry date.

Wealth management – Our holistic approach
We leverage our independence and expertise to provide investment, wealth planning and private office solutions to clients with complex financial needs.
Our holistic approach
As an individual or family with a substantial net worth, your wealth is likely spread across many different asset structures. Perhaps it is still concentrated in a business, or it may be diversified across a broad range of financial assets. Often it is a complicated mix that is difficult to keep track of let alone manage.
That’s where we come in. We provide investment, wealth planning and private office solutions designed specifically to manage this complexity and simplify it for you. With expertise in our key client markets of Europe, Asia and Latin America, our team of specialists and partners have a deep understanding of your culture as well as the regulatory environments where your assets are held.
Our wealth planning solutions are designed to structure your wealth, manage your assets, and prepare for transition to the next generation. We cover the entire wealth planning spectrum – from companies, trusts and foundations to life insurance policies and private label funds.
For your liquid assets, our investment solutions offer you either discretionary portfolio management that follows a dynamic absolute return investment strategy or bespoke advisory services that allow you to play a more active role in the investment process.
We also support the individual needs of our clients with private office services upon request.
One advisor. One point of contact.
At Marcuard Heritage, wealth management centers around trust and loyalty, which is why we place high value in the open and honest relationship you have with your personal advisor. With an intimate understanding of your individual situation, family dynamics and long-term objectives, your advisor actively manages your investments and executes your individual wealth management plan backed by our team of specialists and network of partners. He or she is your one point of contact, dedicating their careers to serving your financial needs.
Our approach to wealth management allows you to regain control, preserve your wealth, and plan for the future. It creates a level of continuity that simplifies your life and provides peace of mind. And that means a wealth of value for you.
Questions?
