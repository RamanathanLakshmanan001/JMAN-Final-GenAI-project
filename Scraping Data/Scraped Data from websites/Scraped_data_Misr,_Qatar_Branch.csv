Message From The Head of HR
Message from the Sector Head
This year marks one of the most definitively transformative phases for the banking sector as we accelerate our transition into the era of digitalization. We continuously strive to encourage a dynamic business conduit that better enables employees, optimizes operations, and potentially transforms business models. With that in mind, our compelling vision to strengthen our core business practice motivates us to deliver pristine products and services that solely rely on the dependability, resourcefulness, and connectivity of our select teams at Banque Misr. In light of our initiatives, as is customary since the early 1920s, we have focused on providing the best recruitment resources that better serve the innovative direction in which the world is now heading.
  Of the many examples that stand out, our “Digital Factory” stands as our current premise that encourages experienced professionals to work together, stipulating the importance of how Banque Misr prioritizes its client’s financial wellbeing as the corner stone of our practice. 
  Across the board of our lines of business, we have undergone and achieved multiple operational milestones that maintain our nationally renowned position; as our “Cultural Transformation Program” for instance has brought together a conglomerate of nearly 16,000 participant employees in a virtual town hall, marking one of the biggest events the bank has ever digitally held since its inception.
  Our motive to hire outstanding calibers has since led us to push our boundaries even further during COVID-19, as our internship opportunities have garnered a staggering number of 60,000 students last year alone.
  As we introduce our strategy for 2022, we rightfully position ourselves as an integral part of Egypt’s growth by identifying numerous pathways for development, while highlighting different areas of expansion for our employees. Our Recruitment Department alone hires 2,000 to 3,000 esteemed handpicked candidates on a yearly basis, and works tirelessly to ensure that our calibers are able to meet set expectations; not just by endorsing their expertise but by also appreciating their collaborative mindsets, their willingness to generate ideas, and their flexibility to strategically work through any given challenges.  
  In light of our current achievements, I would like to formally extend my regards to those who in the pursuit of excellence, have strived to do more and potentially achieve much more than they’ve initially perceived. Through the Recruitment Department’s efforts and strategies, we efficiently pave the way for bright young minds to explore their own path toward incredulous success.

Literacy and financial Inclusion
Literacy And Financial Inclusion
The concept of financial inclusion involves offering financial services to all segments of society – whether they be individuals or institutions – and striving to enable these segments to utilize such services, by providing financial services that are of an acceptable quality and a reasonable price through official financial channels.
Banque Misr is considered one of the first banks to lay the foundations of financial inclusion, being the first bank to be established with Egyptian capital for the purpose of investing the savings of Egyptians and integrating these savings into the formal national economy. As such, the Bank consistently supports the efforts of the Egyptian state towards fulfilling financial inclusion, with the aim of allowing all social segments access to financial products and services that fulfil their various needs; especially Egyptian youths, which constitute the largest segment of society. Banque Misr has partaken in numerous initiatives and events that seek to drive these efforts; such as the national initiative launched by the Egyptian Banking Institute, “Ashan Bokra” in 2012, under the auspices of the Central Bank of Egypt, in the area of financial education and the development of financial products and services that suit children and youths in Egypt and the Middle East. This is in addition to the Bank’s regular participation in the Arab Day for Financial Inclusion, International Youth Day, and other functions.

Responsible Banking And Sustainability
Sustainability Initiative
Driven by its first mission, Banque Misr’s full compliance with the best sustainability practices at a very early stage has been reinforcing its distinctive leadership position in the markets where it operates. Banque Misr strategically capitalizes on sustainability performance to deliver on the targets as envisioned by the UN’s 2030 Agenda and prominently prioritizes the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted regarding its substantial socioeconomic and ecological impacts. Working together, we further integrate the principles of good governance across the bank’s operations.
As a leading financial institution in Egypt, Banque Misr gives great importance to corporate social responsibility and adheres to the UN Global Compact ten standards, which include the following; non-discrimination, equality, human rights, abolition of human labor, health and safety, governance and anti-corruption. The bank also takes into consideration all other standards in relation to achieve sustainability through assessing the environmental impact of activities related to performance indicators on all fronts.
'Banque Misr  was keen as the first Egyptian government-owned bank, was keen to report on its business operations according to the GRI standards. The GRI standards mean that the business activities are compliant with sustainability principles through governance, human rights, anti-corruption, society participation, environmental standards, transparency, and disclosure.
Banque Misr signed the United Nations Environment Programme's Finance Initiative (UNEP FI). The initiative aims at achieving sustainable development and social and environmental responsibility by institutions. This latest move places Banque Misr among responsible banks that conduct their business in accordance with the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Climate Agreement.The announcement was made during the United Nations General Assembly annual meeting that took place on 22 September 2019 in New York.

The bank also takes into consideration all other standards in relation to achieve sustainability through assessing the environmental impact of activities related to performance indicators on all fronts.
'Banque Misr  was keen as the first Egyptian government-owned bank, was keen to report on its business operations according to the GRI standards. The GRI standards mean that the business activities are compliant with sustainability principles through governance, human rights, anti-corruption, society participation, environmental standards, transparency, and disclosure.
