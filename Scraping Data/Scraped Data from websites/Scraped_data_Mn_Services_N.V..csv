Commercial Carpet Cleaning
Services
Carpet Cleaning on a Commercial Scale
Your floors say a lot about your establishment, especially when you have carpet. Unsightly stains send messages of neglect, the last thing you want to project to your clientele. Carpeting can also harbor unpleasant odors, further damaging visitors’ perception of your cleanliness.
Commercial carpet is subjected to more traffic and stain opportunities, and it’s not easy to maintain. This particularly holds true if you’re currently managing cleaning tasks in-house. Heavy-duty commercial carpet cleaning can not only remove stains and odors, it can help to prolong the overall life of your carpeting.
The Importance of Thorough Carpet Cleaning
The most thorough vacuuming routine will still leave dirt, bacteria and pollutants behind to lurk in carpet fibers. Even if there is minimal staining and discoloration, the carpet in your facility may still be capable of making employees and clientele sick. Healthier people inside your facility mean higher productivity and better results.
It is also wise to recognize the importance of appearances for public-facing organizations. Stains, dirty-looking carpet and unpleasant smells send all the wrong signals to people inside your building, coloring their perceptions of the organization as a whole in some cases. Putting your best foot forward, so to speak, means ensuring your facility is clean, pleasant-smelling and welcoming.
High-Quality Cleaning Services for Carpet
Removing deep stains and discoloration requires more than the right equipment; it also requires knowledge of the right products and tactics to address a variety of factors contributing to problems with your commercial carpeting.
Our expert cleaning professionals provide stain removal and general carpet cleaning services to eliminate odors, stains and potential sources of illness. With our help, you can get additional years out of your existing carpet, saving a significant amount of money while still presenting a fresh, clean facility to employees, visitors and clientele. If your carpet is stained and smells unpleasant, call us today at MN Services for a cleaning plan tailored to the unique needs of your establishment.
“I've been able to call on this staff to help us through emergency clean-ups (burst water pipes, fast apartment turnovers) and specialty cleaning problems (carpet stain removal, high traffic floor finish, water damage). In all cases they provided partnership and expertise needed to complete the task. I recommend this company without hesitation.”

Special Event
Set-Up Services
Coordinating a corporate gathering, hosting a wedding or celebrating any auspicious occasion on a large scale requires a significant amount of time, energy and dedication. Special event setup alone in the Minneapolis-St. Paul Metro can be a demanding job, not to mention the other responsibilities you have as a host.
Many of the tasks related to your special event will require your attention, but some can be outsourced. Setting up equipment is one of those tasks. Working with professionals who understand the unique needs of your event can not only help you work more efficiently, but also ensure a successful event overall.
Full-Service Special Event Setup
At MN Services, we’ve built our business around helping our clients realize their goals, whether they are related to ongoing general maintenance and cleanliness or a one-time setup and breakdown for special events. Our skilled team will ensure everything is set up to your exact specifications, leaving you with a prepared site and no worries. When you are hosting an event anywhere in the Metro Twin Cities area, we are here to help make sure it all runs smoothly and efficiently.
Cleaning Up After a Special Event
Our service offerings go far beyond setup, though. When your event ends, we offer cleaning and janitorial services to help put your space back in order. This means the most time-consuming and physically demanding aspects of your event are taken care of by dedicated professionals, not you and your staff. You are free to concentrate on the event itself, and the happiness of attendees. We can help with:
Weddings
Graduations
Funerals
Luncheons
Executive meetings
Corporate parties
and more!
Contact us today at MN Services to learn more about how we take the pressure and stress out of special event setup, breakdown and cleanup, all with a single point of contact.

Floor Stripping & Waxing
Services
Heavy traffic typically means a bustling Metro Twin Cities business, but it can wreak havoc with the finish and appearance of your floors. Neglected vinyl composite (VCT) flooring, concrete and terrazzo floors can all become dingy and discolored over time, which can have a negative impact when it comes to customer and visitor impressions. Floor stripping and waxing services, when provided by knowledgeable professionals, can breathe new life into even heavily stained floors.
How Does Professional Floor Stripping and Waxing Work?
When people enter your facility, they form an impression of your entire operation based largely upon the appearance of your space. Thorough and regular mopping is often insufficient to maintain a good appearance, especially in areas that are subjected to heavy and frequent foot traffic. Floor stripping and waxing can remove deep-set stains and discoloration that mopping alone cannot remove.
First, a stripping agent is applied to the floor with a mop, where it will sit for a period of time to break down grease, stains, deep-trodden dirt and grime. Floors are then scrubbed with a specialized machine to further address discoloration, while edging and hard-to-reach spots are scrubbed by hand. Once the stripping and scrubbing process is complete, any remaining stripping agent is removed from the floor surface using a wet vac.
A neutralizing agent is applied and removed, followed by a thorough mopping and a third pass with the wet vac. When floors are completely dry and free of any moisture, sometimes via the use of air movers and high-powered fans, any dust is removed to ensure a clear surface for multiple coats of protective finish. The end result is shining, stain-free flooring that is more resistant to future wear and tear.
Professional Floor Care
The knowledgeable cleaning professionals at MN Services can help ensure you always make a good impression on anyone who enters your building with glistening and stain-free floors. Call us today for a customized plan to get your floors clean and beautiful without an expensive replacement.

Our History
A half-century ago, Jim Glover started providing commercial cleaning services to businesses in the Metro Twin Cities area to fund his education at the University of Minnesota. Pairing this education with his experience running a business, Jim was able to turn MN Services into not only a full-time career for himself, but also a source of employment for more than 500 local professionals.
Now, we help our clients maintain more than 15 million square feet of space each day throughout a variety of industries, including manufacturing plants, office buildings, car dealerships, preschools, K-12 schools, universities, banks, medical facilities, churches, senior living associations and apartments, just to name a few.
Customized Commercial Cleaning Services
We are not a franchise business; we are a locally-owned and operated business staffed by professionals who understand the unique needs of commercial clients in the Metro Twin Cities. This independence grants us the flexibility to customize our cleaning services for each client, devising a strategy which places their needs at the center of everything we do at MN Services. Our business philosophy is built around a central tenet: it’s our job to manage the quality of your facilities cleaning, not yours. We place a dedicated representative in a position of responsibility for each of our clients, ensuring they have a dedicated point of contact for everything from daily communications to minor issues, in addition to day-to-day oversight of all cleaning.
Hands-On Quality Control
Our dedicated representatives and each cleaning team are made up of professionals who are carefully screened during the hiring process to ensure they’re capable of providing not only the very best in cleaning, but also exceptional customer service and a clear understanding of their role and responsibility within the building of a client. We take the hiring process seriously, because we feel the most important part of maintaining facilities for our clients is focusing on the personnel who provide the services.
We take an active approach to management, including weekly inspections while crews are on-site to ensure all work meets our exacting standards. Contact us today to learn more about the services we provide, and how we can help you focus on the aspects of your business that only you can manage by taking the responsibility of facility management off your plate.
Our Service Areas
Commercial facility cleaning services in the Twin Cities and the greater metro suburbs including Minneapolis – Minnetonka – Plymouth – Wayzata – Eden Prairie – Chanhassen – Chaska – Hopkins – Bloomington – Burnsville – Edina – Maple Grove – Fridley – Blaine – Brooklyn Park – Brooklyn Center – Roseville – St. Paul – Shoreview – Woodbury –  and more! 
Quality Control
Our management philosophy is based on the conviction that it’s our job to manage the quality of your facilities cleaning, not yours.  Most companies take a passive approach to managing, and assume that if they don’t hear from you everything is fine.  By contrast, we do weekly inspections while crews are onsite to make sure that any problems are taken care of immediately. 
Flexibility
We will customize a cleaning program specific to your facility’s needs. We understand things change and we’re happy to make adjustments. Our goal is to build a strong partnership, and that’s accomplished by personalized attention.
Worker Selection
In addition to exceptional management, we feel the single most important part of any maintenance program is the personnel who actually do the cleaning. We hire only those individuals who are capable of superior service, who are responsible for their actions within a client’s building, and who are visually presentable. All personnel considered for employment must have both business and personal references.
Account Management
Each building has one person responsible for daily communications with the customer’s representative.  They will handle any minor issues that arise and provide oversight of day-to-day cleaning needs and arrangements.
Our Mission
Mission Statement
“I've been able to call on this staff to help us through emergency clean-ups (burst water pipes, fast apartment turnovers) and specialty cleaning problems (carpet stain removal, high traffic floor finish, water damage). In all cases they provided partnership and expertise needed to complete the task. I recommend this company without hesitation.”

COVID-19 Disinfecting Program
MN Services, Inc. is trained and equipped to disinfect your facilities prior to reopening for your employees, staff, students, residents or worship family.  We can also clean your facility if you have had a “confirmed or suspected” case of COVID-19 in your building.
Using CDC approved disinfecting guidelines we have the capability of disinfecting your classrooms, bathrooms, offices, sanctuary, hand rails, elevator buttons, drinking fountains, door handles, light switches and other touch points prior to bringing families, staff and/or students back into your building when your operations resume.  We use a hospital grade disinfectant that is a virucide against HUMAN CORONAVIRUS, as well as over 20 other viruses.
We will design a program specific to your building by using a combination of disinfecting foggers and hand wiping surfaces for the safety and peace of mind it can afford you, employees, students, parents and/or worship community.
Please contact us immediately for more information.

Electrical Maintenance
Services
We understand there is more to maintaining your facility than simply keeping it clean. We provide light electrical and plumbing maintenance for our cleaning clients, as well. Learn more about how we work to improve productivity and effectiveness for you without introducing more supervisory work or the hiring of in-house maintenance staff by ensuring your facility is always clean, well-maintained and operating effectively.
The Importance of Quality Electrical Maintenance
Your facility depends on a wide variety of electrical components to keep things up and running smoothly, but the little things can be some of the most important. Broken light switches, malfunctioning fixtures and blown bulbs complicate things for everyone in your facility. Because we understand how important these things are, we offer a wider scope of services than the average janitorial company.
Our skilled and experienced staff can take care of the little things for you, leaving you free to invest more of your time and energy in the things that matter most. When larger problems loom, we will bring in a licensed electrician to ensure everything is completed safely, accurately and in accordance with all applicable guidelines.
Full-Service Facility Management
MN Services is founded upon the belief that you should not have to focus on maintenance and cleaning, so we’ve devised a system that takes much of the daily stress off your plate entirely. Our expert staff provides more than cleaning; we work to make sure you never have to worry about flickering lights interfering with the work you do. Our integrated approach to maintenance management gives you the ability to outsource many troublesome maintenance tasks in addition to thorough cleaning. Call or contact us today for a free quote, and to learn how integrated facilities cleaning and management can be a catalyst for positive change throughout your operation.

Janitorial
Services
MN Services professionals provide janitorial services for more than fifteen million square feet of space each day across the Metro Twin Cities. While we offer a range of services, janitorial and custodial care are the core function around which our family-owned business is built.
The Benefits of Outsourcing Custodial Needs
We believe our customers should be able to enjoy their clean spaces without having to supervise the process, so we conduct weekly inspections while cleaning crews are on-site. At MN Services, we firmly believe it’s our job to manage the quality of your facilities cleaning, not yours. This means you are free to spend time managing your business, not the cleaning crew. Outsourcing will give you freedom from managing additional in-house staff, something MN Services is dedicated to providing.
Since the cleanliness of your building can affect employee health, customer impressions and productivity, working with a professional janitorial crew can have a significant impact on your business. You, your staff and your clients are able to reap the benefits of a clean, sanitary environment with no hassle and no stress.
What Are Janitorial Services?
While general office cleaning and janitorial services may seem to be interchangeable, they are quite different from one another. Anyone can empty wastebaskets and run a cloth over hard surfaces; janitorial care means sanitized restrooms, doorknobs, desks and other common surfaces known to harbor illness-causing viruses and bacteria. Our expert janitorial staff is extensively trained to know which chemical products are best suited to a particular use, how to maintain sanitary conditions and how to care for a variety of flooring types to ensure they are always looking their best.
No two buildings are alike in the Metro Twin Cities, and no two jobs come with the same requirements. MN Services offers a fully customizable janitorial services package designed to keep your facility in peak condition.
“I've been able to call on this staff to help us through emergency clean-ups (burst water pipes, fast apartment turnovers) and specialty cleaning problems (carpet stain removal, high traffic floor finish, water damage). In all cases they provided partnership and expertise needed to complete the task. I recommend this company without hesitation.”

How Cleaning Services Can Make a Difference
Cleaner facilities mean better productivity for a number of reasons, especially when it comes to employee sick days. Viral and bacterial diseases can spread quickly in close quarters, especially when commonly-touched surfaces are not cleaned properly. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that phones, faucets, desktops and doorknobs be sanitized daily to limit the spread of illnesses.  We will provide you with these sanitary services at your request.
Working with dedicated and knowledgeable cleaning and maintenance professionals means more than tidier spaces. It can mean a healthier, more productive working environment while simultaneously ensuring you always make a good impression on your customers. Since we also provide minor maintenance services such as carpentry, painting, plumbing and electrical, we are uniquely positioned to ensure your Metro Twin Cities facility is not only clean, but also safe and functioning properly.

Call us today to learn more about our service range, and to explore the benefits of outsourcing facility maintenance.

Plumbing Maintenance
Services
Few facilities issues can disrupt the flow of productivity in a commercial setting faster than a plumbing problem. When toilets don’t flush properly or drains are clogged, it commands the attention of everyone who enters your building and uses your facilities. This means it is important to address even the small issues right away, but this can be easier said than done when you are responsible for more than just the condition of your facility.
Integrated Facilities and Plumbing Maintenance
Maintaining an in-house maintenance staff is expensive, and it adds more responsibility to those in supervisory roles. Because plumbing concerns are typically few and far between with good maintenance, there is often a lack of demand sufficient to justify the expense of a full-time employee for a part-time issue.
Minor clogs and malfunctioning toilets can be surprisingly expensive, particularly in terms of lost productivity and staff satisfaction. At MN Services, we do more than keep your facility clean. We work to keep it in top condition by not only repairing minor issues but coordinating repairs of a more serious nature with a licensed plumber.
Low-Maintenance Facility Maintenance
We want to be the easiest company you work with, which means we provide more than simple janitorial and cleaning services. We know there is more than meets the eye to maintaining a commercial, industrial or institutional building than merely keeping it clean, so we work to make sure everything works as intended.
Our proactive approach to maintenance means we assume more of the responsibility than the average cleaning crew, so you can spend more of your time working on achieving goals and raising your organization to greater heights. To learn more about how we help take the stress and worry of plumbing maintenance and light repairs off your plate, call or contact us today.
