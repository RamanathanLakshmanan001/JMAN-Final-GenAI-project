OFFICE MAINTENANCE
Office Maintenance & Logistics
Office Maintenance & Logistics are key features in the smooth running of any business, however the associated tasks with maintenance and logistics are often burdensome and time consuming. That being said, these laborious tasks, if not carried out adequately, may mean the abrupt end to any business since these tasks may be considered as the lifeline of a business. Thus it is vital that such tasks are done correctly through the allocation of adequate time and resources. Unfortunately not many businesses have such resources available and consequently Lingam Contracting &  Design Ltd may provide for these needs.

BUSINESS TO BUSINESS INTRODUCTIONS
International Business made easy
  At Juanafil Group, the goal is to initiate professional connections that can lead to growth, sales, or strategic alliances.
Here are some ways we structure B2B introductions effectively:
Email Introductions: We receive requests by customers to find and match.  It is always our pleasure to meet up to better understand the requisites and to, eventually, couple business partners.
In-Person Introductions: When geographically possible we match business partners at a Board-table in order to, not only introduce people but also, create a think-tank with prospects.
Referral Introductions: A simple telephone call is enough to create a request and to follow up with a referral but at Juanafil Group, we believe that business meetings do enhance the prospects of ventures taking place.

STAFF TRAINING
Malta Institute for Business Studies Ltd.
 a member of the Juanafil ™ Group (accreditation ref 356022014)
Adult Courses
In-service training
  Members of the public are invited to request courses that help them acquire academic formation and training in the subjects mentioned below.
Clients and corporate clients of the Juanafil ™ Group are urged to organized in-service training for their employees.
Staff Training is a vital component in the start up or continuance of any business or company, regardless of size or type. This may be attributed to the fact that the running of any business or company heavily depends on the staff-compliment. This is due to it being rather impossible to have just one person doing all the work alone when assignment of work to different individuals may prove greatly beneficial to the business or company as a whole.
It may come as no surprise that staff may make or break a business and thus proper staff training is not a commodity but rather a necessity. Malta Institute for Business Studies, referred to in short as MIBS, is an institute set up in 1998 to provide the necessary staff training for the proper functioning of any business through a wide range of available courses . The Malta Institute for Business Studies strives to offer its clients adequate staff training according to their needs.
We host and teach….. we travel and teach!
Staff Training need not only be utilised when employing new staff. Malta Institute for Business Studies is geared to offer refresher courses for those members of staff who have been employed with the company or business for an extended period of time and need an extra push so as to relive any feeling of inferiority between older staff and new entrants at work. Refresher courses may focus on any of the following areas:
Management responsibilities
Middle Management and Industrial relations
HR Management
Data Protection
IT Department and protection
Secretarial duties
Finance and Interpretation of accounting
Introduction to law
Marketing, Sales and mystery shopping
Web presence & optimization
Debt Collection
Credit Control
Occupational Health & Safety, including risks
Fire prevention and awareness
Psychology at the work place
