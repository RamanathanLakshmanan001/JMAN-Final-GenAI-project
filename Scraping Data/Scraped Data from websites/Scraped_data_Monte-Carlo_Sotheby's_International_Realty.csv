Sotheby's - An extraordinary History
On March 11, 1744, Samuel Baker, founder of Sotheby's, held the first-ever sale under his own name. The library of a certain Rt. Hon. Sir John Stanley, Bart. described as ""containing several Hundred scarce and valuable books in all branches of Polite Literature"" sold for a few hundred pounds. Modest though Samuel Baker's first sale might seem today, he was not without connections - or ambitions. Indeed, he and his successors were to handle, with great panache and showmanship, many of the great libraries sold at auction. On Napoleon's death, the books the French Emperor had taken with him into exile on St. Helena were sent to Sotheby's for sale. Additionally, libraries from Prince Talleyrand, John Willkes, Benjamin Heywood Bright, the Marquis of Lansdowne, and the Dukes of Devonshire and Buckingham were all sold through Samuel Baker's auctions.

Sotheby's in New Bond Street
By the end of the First World War, the firm had so successfully expanded its role in the art market that new premises were required. In 1917, Sotheby's moved from its Wellington Street location to its famous New Bond Street saleroom, which has remained its London base ever since.
Arrival in fashionable New Bond Street also heralded a new era during which the turnover for paintings and other works of art finally began to outstrip books and literary property. This move towards a wider sales arena was a very deliberate one, and the charge was led in the area of Old Master Paintings and Drawings.
This diversification effort paved the way for the explosive growth of the firm under the leadership of Peter Wilson.

The era Peter Wilson
Wilson, who joined the firm in 1936, took Sotheby's onto the global stage. He ensured the firm's readiness to capitalize on the meteoric rise in popularity of Impressionist and Modern paintings. Perhaps the single most sensational and ultimately influential sale during Wilson's tenure was the famous Goldschmidt sale of 1958.
The Goldschmidt collection comprised seven of the most exquisite Impressionist and Modern paintings ever to come to auction. An evening auction was decided upon - the first at Sotheby's since the 18th century - and those attending were to wear evening dress. Fourteen hundred did attend; including Somerset Maugham, Anthony Quinn, Kirk Douglas, and Lady Churchill as well as hundreds of art dealers from all over the world. The seven pictures were all sold in just 21 minutes. They fetched £.781,000, the highest total ever reached at that time at a fine art sale.
Cezanne's “Garçon au Gilet Rouge” was sold to Paul Mellon for £.220,000, more than five times the previous record for a painting at auction. It was one of the social highlights of the year, and possibly the most exciting art auction of the century.
Largely thanks to the vision of Peter Wilson, Sotheby's recognized long before its rivals that art was becoming an international market. It was because of this that the company opened an office in New York in 1955; and, more importantly, acquired Parke-Bernet in 1964. Parke-Bernet was the United State's largest fine art auction house, and following its acquisition by Sotheby's, became crucially involved in the rapidly developing North American market for Impressionist and Modern paintings. Parke-Bernet, and its President Louis Marion, had a distinguished history of selling major collections at record prices. The most dramatic moment for the firm came in 1961, when Marion oversaw the sale of Rembrandt's Aristotle Contemplating the Bust of Homer to The Metropolitan Museum of Art for a record $2,300,000. That record stood for 18 years, until it was broken in a Sotheby's sale by another Marion - his son John, who later became the firm's Chairman.
With the greatest American auction house now a part of Sotheby's, the company looked elsewhere for further opportunities. In 1967, offices opened in Paris, Los Angeles and Houston. In 1968 it was Melbourne, Florence and Toronto. In 1969, Zurich, Munich and Edinburgh joined the list. Expansion continued throughout the 1970s, with offices opening across much of Europe, a provincial network in Britain, offices in Asia as well as numerous new addresses across the United States. Along with many other businesses at the time, Sotheby's chose this period of rapid growth to ""go public."" The share issue in 1977 was oversubscribed 26 times, and within 18 months the value of a share had more than doubled.

The past 40 years
The early 1980s, a period of market and corporate uncertainty, was followed in 1983 by the acquisition of Sotheby's by businessman A. Alfred Taubman and a small group of investors. Led by Michael Ainslie, Sotheby's once again became a private company. At the same time, the art market was revitalized by several important sales that set the stage for the series of auctions at Sotheby's which have entered the history books for their drama, their prices and for the way they captured the public's imagination.

It’s in 1297, that Monaco’s history takes an important turn with the arrival of François Grimaldi, statesman from Genoa. Dressed as a Franciscan monk, he came asking for alysum to the Palace, where he takes over the « Rocher », establishing the Grimaldi’s dynasty in Monaco. Legendary character and founder of the Principality, he owns the « Malizia » (the Cunning) nickname, from this episod. Since more than 700 years, the Malizia’s heirs are leading the Principality and the coat of arms of Monaco’s lords are two monks brandishing a sword. A magnificent François Grimaldi’s tribute statue, made by the sculptor Kess Verkade is located on the Place du Palais.    
Crédits: palais.mc                                                                                                                                   Crédits: wikipedia But it is only in the 19th century that Monaco’s renown has experienced an international expension thanks to Prince Charles III, with the help of François and Marie Blanc. Together, they built in 1863 the Société des Bains de Mer on the « Mont-Charles » - better known as « Monte-Carlo » - and develop the Casino and the Carré d’Or : prestigious palaces, luxurious gardens, stunning villas… François Blanc enhances the Principality and in 1868, the train station opened, allowing a wealthy clientele to spend the winter in the French Riviera. The Opera is ordered to the famous architect Charles Garnier and many artists come to perform in the Principality, along with intellectuals and royal families during the show or the Casino’s games. Monaco’s renown is established, but the Prince Rainier III will raise it to an international rank. Nicknamed the « Prince Builder », he starts important developing constructions for the country and builds, on the sea, the Fontvieille and Larvotto neighbourhood. He will have 3 children with his wife, Grace Kelly, actress and muse of Alfred Hitchcock and remains in the heart of the Monegasque population as the Prince who led the Principality to an international level. His son, Prince Albert II, was enthroned in 2005 and married Charlène Wittstock in 2011.    
Crédits: Monte-Carlo Sotheby's International Realty                                Crédits: palais.mc Since then, Monaco remains a must-seen place on the international level. Every year, many celebrities, politicians, artist and billionaires are welcomed by the Princely family during several fashionable events – such as the Bal de la Rose. Numerous sport events, such as the Formula 1 Grand Prix and the Monte-Carlo Master Series – key step for ATP, contribute to the international influence of the Principality.   A unique environment. Thanks to its exceptional location, Monaco is a strategic point in Europe. Located less than 2 hours aways from the main European capitals, the Principalty enjoys a unique living environment. The International Nice Airport can be reached within 30 minutes by car or 5 minutes by helicopter from the Fontvieille Helipad. Articulated around a Port allowing the reception of numerous yachts, Monaco has for several years witnessed the establishment of many reference brands in the field of luxury, gastronomy and elegance. In order to align with the biggest cities’ standings, new buildings have emerged these last years, including the Palais de la Plage, the Tour Odéon or the One Monte-Carlo. Within these high-end residences, the international clientele can benefit from custom services from the greatest palaces.

Living in Monaco : all the advantages of the Principality
Settling and living in Monaco
Monaco & Monte-Carlo: Two simple words that still evoke a myth or dream and prestige... Monaco's exceptional location on the legendary Riviera, between sea and mountains, its parks, its high society and exceptional events make it the ideal destination for a romantic vacation... or for an entire lifetime. Moving to Monaco offers both investors and entrepreneurs an exceptional and secure infrastructure combined with the advantages of an attractive fiscal system for real estate investment in Monaco. Monaco in figures: demography, education and amenities for moving to Monaco Based on the latest official figures, there are approx. 40.000 inhabitants in the Principality of Monaco of which approx. 10.000 are Monegasque. Monaco residents from all over the world can place their children in a wide variety of schools which are either a part of, or affiliated with, the Ministry of Education. Living in Monaco means that the curriculum and the diplomas obtained are the same as in France. Already in elementary school, pupils are taught not only English and French, but also ""Munegu"", the traditional local language, as well as the history of Monaco. The high school graduation rate (the passing of the French National Baccalauréat exam) is close to 99%. Monaco's excellent infrastructure connects the Principality to all the main European capitals which can be reached in less than 2 hours. The same infrastructure allows the many local financial institutions to respond to the demands of a most exacting international clientele. This combination of excellent infrastructure, high quality of living and advantageous tax regime make living in Monaco the internationally sought after place it is and has always been.  
Quartier de la Condamine - Crédit: Monte-Carlo Sotheby's International Realty Is Monaco safe for those moving to Monaco ? Monaco is one of the safest places on earth. One policeman for every 80 residents, 24-hour video surveillance of the entire Principality, a transmission system worthy of the best armies in the world, the possibility of blocking all access in and out of the Principality in several minutes as well as surveillance teams inside the Casino of Monte-Carlo Carlo and in all of the gambling establishments and hotels make Monaco's security second to none. Living in Monaco offers a level of safety that encourages many people to consider moving to Monaco. The Monaco police department is managed by a highly placed member of the French Police Force and the police department is amongst the most modern and efficient in Europe. The rule imposed by the late Prince Rainier III was simple: ""Monaco must have total security"". The instructions given to the 520 police officers trained intensively for almost 2 years are of the strictest. The result is an incredibly low crime rate, the dream of any Interior Minister. As one jeweller in Monaco once so pointedly put it: ""In Monaco, jewels are made to be worn, even on the street, and not to be left in a safety deposit box!"". All these reasons encourage lots of clients to invest in real estate and live in Monaco.  
Fontvieille                                                                                            Le Casino de Monte-Carlo
Crédit: Monte-Carlo Sotheby's International Realty Hospitals and healthcare for those living in Monaco The government of the Principality of Monaco attaches a great deal of importance to the quality of its health facilities, of which 3 main famous facilities:
- The Princess Grace Hospital Hospital is equipped with the latest generation of medical material (scanner, IRM, Radiology,...). The Monaco Government expects the end of the construction of the new hospital around 2023. It will accommodate patients in a modern, efficient and pleasant setting. The CHPG created a unique offer to preserve the health of its patients, the « Monaco Princess Grace Check Up Unit ».
- The Cardio-Thoracic Center, created in 1987, treats all manner of thoracic and cardiac pathologies.
- The IMSS (Monegasque Institute of Sports Medicine) dedicated to medicine and osteo-articular surgery, consulted by all international sportsmen. Moving to Monaco provides access to top-tier healthcare, which is essential for those who decide to live in Monaco.  
Crédit: Vinci Living in Monaco : Culture & Events Independent country of approx. 2 sq.km, Monaco proposes all year long numerous cultural events and promotes the development of the Arts in the Principality. Culture benefits from 5% of the State budget devoted to developing a high-quality artistic programme and supporting artists. Living in Monaco means having access to prominent cultural and artistic events such as: - The Printemps des Arts, under the high patronage of H.R.H. Princess Caroline de Hanovre ,
- All shows of the Ballets of Monte-Carlo,
- Concerts of the Orchestre Philarmonique de Monaco and the Opera,
- Numerous artists performing during different public events,
- Artists exhibitions and private collections,
- There are several theaters, including the Opéra Garnier, the Théâtre Princesse Grace, the Grimaldi Forum, la Salle des Variétés…
- Sotheby’s Auction which has an office in Monaco as other Auctions houses.

Sport has also an important place in the Principality with :
- The famous Formula 1 Grand Prix that takes place in the whole Principality with one of the last remaining FIA tracks in town,
- The ASM Football Club which receive international teams for the National League, Europa League and UEFA Champions League in the Stade Louis II,
- The Roca Team which stands on the Basket Ball National higher ranks each year,
- The Monte-Carlo Rolex Master that has become a main step of the ATP,
- The Jumping which takes place on the Port Hercule in June each year,
- Professional and amateur regattas are organized all year long by the Monaco Yacht Club,
- The Principality is also represented at the Olympic games each year. Living in Monaco allows residents to enjoy a vibrant sporting culture.  
Crédit: ASM Monaco An Ecologic Conscience The Principality and its Government are committed to transmitting a strong ecological conscience to future generations. Students in the Principality are made aware from an early age and the Principality's projects go hand in hand with this ecological awareness, particularly in terms of the fight against climate change and the country's energy security. Strong objectives have been set for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving energy efficiency by 20% in private and public buildings, consuming 20% of final energy from renewable energy sources and maintaining stable peak power consumption.

These ambitious objectives aim to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and reduce its emissions by more than 50% by 2030. Moving to Monaco aligns with participating in a community that values sustainability and renewable energy. In Monaco, waste that can be recovered for energy is transferred to the Fontvieille Station, where starts the process to recover as energy: electricity, hot and cold. Monte-Carlo Sotheby’s International Realty supports you in your project to invest in luxury real estate apartment in Monaco and live in Monaco.

LISTING
Price for a parking space or a garage in Monaco goes hand in hand with the prices of the properties for sale in the Principality. But beyond the price, parking spaces are real investments as you can get 2% of rental return, which is very unusual with apartments. Building charges are also very low and the demand is important as there are lots of old-style houses with no attached parking spaces.
