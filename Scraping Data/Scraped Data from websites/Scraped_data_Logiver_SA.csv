The Individual Investment Mandates route
In order to ideally maximize returns on investments whilst minimizing risks linked to asset allocation in different asset classes (such as equity, fixed income or alternative investments including real estate), individual investment mandates can be tailored to every client of LOGIVER whilst respecting their individual risk preferences and maintaining an approach true to the company’s fundamental investment philosophy.
Our Investment Services
The Collective Investment Scheme route
The benefit of selecting this investment route resides in the possibility to gain access, whilst reducing transaction costs, to a very well diversified investment methodology one may not be in a position to construct individually. The quantum of assets managed through the pooling of clients’ moneys reduces the inherent volatility of the portfolio manager’s strategy and helps increase returns through time.
Our Investment Services
The Family Office Mandates route
Family offices are private wealth management firms providing a range of financial services and advice to high-net-worth individuals and their families. They ensure wealth preservation over multiple generations and serve as a one-stop-shop in order to manage a family’s wealth and its diversified financial holdings.
Thanks to its family office license, LOGIVER is ideally positioned to provide financial planning, investment management, tax planning, estate planning as well as other related services through an articulated family office mandate which therefore goes well above and beyond the management of entrusted assets.

Sustainable Investment Policy
In accordance with Article 6 of the SFDR (“Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation”), LOGIVER currently does not incorporate ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) criteria in its investment policies.
Data Protection Notice
LOGIVER places great importance on the protection of your personal data.
In the context of managing and monitoring the business relationship, LOGIVER acts as the data controller and processes the personal data of the Client, including its individual representatives. The processing is carried out by LOGIVER in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of April 27, 2016, related to the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and the free movement of such data (“GDPR”), as well as all other applicable legal standards, including the Luxembourg law of August 1, 2018, implementing the GDPR.
As the data controller, LOGIVER can be contacted for any question related to data processing at the following coordinates:
LOGIVER – F.A.O. the Data Protection Officer
Adress : 12 rue Jean Engling, App 14A, L-1466 Luxembourg
Phone : +352 26 97 60 53
Email : dpo@logiver.com
The processing that LOGIVER carries out is necessary for the provision, successful completion, and improvement of services to the Client. In relation to the business relationship, the purposes are:
Discretionary management of the Client’s assets,
Compliance with legal and regulatory obligations, particularly in terms of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing and tax matters,
Internal monitoring and the preparation of regulatory reports to authorities,
Detection and prevention of fraud, business development through direct marketing actions and client events,
Execution and preservation of evidence concerning the Client’s financial transactions,
Assessment of the suitability of financial instruments subscribed by the Client,
Defence of LOGIVER ‘s interests in court.
Processing for these purposes is based on LOGIVER‘s compliance with its legal or regulatory obligations, the execution of a contract to which the Client is a party, or the legitimate interest of LOGIVER, as defined in the GDPR 2016/679.
LOGIVER retains personal data either for the period necessary to meet applicable legal or regulatory obligations or – for evidential purposes – until the expiry of the period during which a judicial or extrajudicial action remains possible, the longest period being considered if multiple periods run concurrently for the same data.
LOGIVER will only transfer the Client’s personal data outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”) if a legal or regulatory provision requires it.
LOGIVER will collect and process certain information to determine the Client’s profile, preferences, and constraints in the context of the contractual relationship between LOGIVER and the Client. This data will be used to statistically analyse and assess the objectives, performances, and actions of the Client to best manage the Client’s assets and interests. The Client may choose to refuse to provide such information to LOGIVER , thus preventing LOGIVER from processing and collecting such data. However, such refusal may hinder the establishment or continuation of business relations between the Client and LOGIVER Such a refusal may, at the very least, limit LOGIVER ‘s ability to provide its services to the Client in the most effective manner possible.
LOGIVER will only request information necessary to fulfil its obligations and perfect its services for the Client. Unless expressly instructed otherwise by the Client or in the case of legal obligations, LOGIVER will not disclose this information to third parties.

The categories of subcontractors that may potentially access Client data are as follows: external IT services; external trustees and accountants; lawyers; notaries and other legal advisers; companies providing software or other technical or mechanical support enabling LOGIVER to provide its services and on which the Client’s data might rely.
In addition to these categories, Luxembourg or foreign public authorities (police, court, etc.) might be recipients of the Client’s data, to the extent and only if these authorities require LOGIVER to produce such data, they are competent to make such a request, and LOGIVER cannot oppose it.
The Client has certain rights concerning only the personal data that concern him. These rights are:
i.     The right to request access to his personal data;
ii.    The right to request the rectification of his personal data;
iii.   The right to request the erasure of his personal data;
iv.    The right to request the limitation of processing of his personal data and to know the impact of such limitation;
v.     The right to object to the processing of his personal data and to know the impact of such opposition;
vi.    The right to data portability;
vii.   When the processing of his data is based on his consent, the right to withdraw his consent at any time without this withdrawal affecting the legality of the prior processing;
viii.  The right to file a complaint with the competent supervisory authority. In Luxembourg, the authority in question is the National Commission for Data Protection (“CNPD”) located at 15, Boulevard du Jazz in L-4370 Belvaux.

OUR PHILOSOPHY
Our investment strategies
The Company firmly believes in the vast amount of academic research which concludes to the fact that ‘Index Asset Management’ is the most appropriate approach to maximize returns whilst reducing risks and volatility through time.
  Also known as ‘Index Investing’ or ‘Passive Investing’ this strategy involves tracking the performance of a specific market index. The goal is to match (not surpass) the returns of this market index. This is achieved by investing in a diversified portfolio of selected securities which are representative of the market index. The advantage lies in the reduction of overall fees and expenses whilst providing the broadest exposure to the market index.
  This also quite naturally removes the risk which ‘Active Asset Management’ carries through time, and which lies in the issue that individual and narrow securities’ selection will never consistently beat a market index over a prolonged period but will rather result in a collection of uncorrelated ‘better than the market’ or ‘worse than the market’ years.
DISCRETIONARY ASSET MANAGEMENT
Our 3 investment strategies
LOGIVER runs 3 Discretionary ‘Index Asset Management’ strategies which it believes allow to match the needs of every investor:
The portfolio is constructed at the start of the mandate and along the lines of the strategic allocation which is anticipated to produce the best risk/reward ratio to the client at onset. The portfolio is then rebalanced (i.e., sales and purchases of securities are carried out through time) in order to always stick to the natural evolution of the original plan of action and in line with the Investment Policy of the Company
The portfolio is constructed at the start of the mandate based on both:
The strategic allocation which is anticipated to produce the best risk/reward ratio to the client at onset and

The tactical allocation which is anticipated to perform best, dwelling on LOGIVER’s financial research and in-house analysis of the current macro-economic market environment.
The individual weights allocated to asset classes vary around the asset distribution defined in the original asset allocation. This variation is the result of the client’s possible existing positions and most importantly of LOGIVER’s current anticipation of future market developments. The portfolio is then rebalanced through time similarly to the Fixed Index Strategy but also taking into consideration the changes in the tactical asset allocation (if any) the Company sees fit to implement in line with its Investment Policy.
The portfolio is constructed at the start of the mandate with both listed and unlisted (‘alternative’) assets. The strategy used for listed assets is the ‘Flexible Indes Strategy’. The unlisted assets ideally remain ujntouched however, uess market conditions are felt to absolutely require acting.
