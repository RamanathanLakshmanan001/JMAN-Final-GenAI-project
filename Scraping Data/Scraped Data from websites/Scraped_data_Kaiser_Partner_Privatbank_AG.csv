A sustainable portfolio for a better future
Sustainable Investing at Kaiser Partner Privatbank
  Sustainability and responsibility for society and the environment are more than just a current trend for us: Kaiser Partner Privatbank was the first bank in Liechtenstein who signed the UN Principles for Responsible Investing (PRI) in 2009. As part of the PRI, we committed us to the ESG: The abbreviation stands for Environmental, Social, and Governance and refers to the three central factors in measuring the sustainability and societal impact of an investment in a company or business. As a result, we fully integrated the ESG criteria into our investment process.
