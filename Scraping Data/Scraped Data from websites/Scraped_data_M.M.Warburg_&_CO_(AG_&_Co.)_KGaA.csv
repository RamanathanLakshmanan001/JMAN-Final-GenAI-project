Was ist Multi Smart Beta? Smart Beta ist ein anderer Begriff für Faktorinvesting. Letztlich geht es darum, Aktien in Portfolios nicht auf Basis ihrer Marktkapitalisierung zu gewichten, sondern aufgrund ihrer fundamentalen und technischen Eigenschaften. Über längere Perioden lässt sich empirisch eindrucksvoll beweisen, dass Faktorportfolios wie unsere Multi Smart Beta Fonds attraktivere Eigenschaften aufweisen als die Benchmark oder zufällig generierte Portfolios.

M.M.Warburg & CO – independent private bank
The future – since 1798
Have you ever thought about what makes a bank excellent? For us, it’s a combination of technical expertise, future-oriented ideas and personal proximity to the customer – and behind that there is much more. Our consulting philosophy is geared towards people and promotes entrepreneurial thinking and action. We encourage our customers to think outside the box and seize promising opportunities – and sometimes that requires bold decisions. We support them in that with individual, tailor-made solutions. The present holds many challenges. We face them and, based on our experience and expertise, sometimes dare to jump in at the deep end – without losing sight of what’s tried and tested. Try us out now and let us become your dependable partner!

Geldanlage in Krisenzeiten

•
Warburg Podcast
Material- und Fachkräftemangel, Energieengpüsse, hohe Inflationsraten und steigende Zinsen - der Gegenwind für Deutschlands Wirtschaft ist derzeit so stark wie selten zuvor. Eine Rezession ist nach Meinung vieler Ökonomen nicht mehr zu vermeiden. Umso mehr gilt es für Anlegende nun, das Portfolio wetterfest zu machen. Doch wie kann dies gelingen? In unserem Podcast diskutiert Carsten Klude, Chefvolkswirt von M.M.Warburg & CO, mit Dr. Peter Seppelfricke, Professor für Allgemeine Betriebswirtschaftslehre, Finanzwirtschaft und Finanzdienstleistungen an der Hochschule Osnabrück, über Chancen und Risiken der Geldanlage in Krisenzeiten. Dabei analysieren beide einzelne Aspekte des Themas, blicken auf makroökonomische Antworten und beleuchten aktuelle Entwicklungen. ""Auch in diesen turbulenten Zeiten sind Aktien noch immer die erste Wahl, denn Aktien sind Sachwerte"", sagt Professor Seppelfricke. So ist man als Anlegender mit Aktien relativ inflationsgeschützt. Welche Kennzahlen die Experten für besonders wichtig und vor allem welche Branchen sie als relativ krisenfest erachten, erfahren Sie im Podcast. Auch bei YouTube. Website LinkedIn

Das Nachhaltigkeitsparadoxon bei Investments
Warburg Podcast
Wer will es nicht – das heißbegehrte „grüne Label“? Immer mehr  Unternehmen verschreiben sich der Nachhaltigkeit – nicht zuletzt, weil  Investoren sonst einen weiten Bogen um sie machen könnten. Nach  Unternehmen in den Sektoren Gas und Atomkraft buhlt derzeit auch die  Rüstungsindustrie um eine ESG-konforme Klassifizierung von Waffen gemäß  der EU-Taxonomie. Eine Tatsache, die angesichts der Bilder aus der  Ukraine, bei vielen Kopfschütteln hervorrufen dürfte. Doch ist die Sache  häufig nicht so klar, wie man auf den ersten Blick meinen könnte.  Müssen wir also einige Themen bezogen auf Nachhaltigkeit neu einordnen? In unserem Podcast diskutiert Dr. Christian Jasperneite, Chief  Investment Officer von M.M.Warburg & CO, mit Christian Aselmann,  Sustainable Investment Manager bei der Kapitalanlagegesellschaft Warburg  Invest, über Nachhaltigkeit und die Schwierigkeit einer endgültigen  Definition des Begriffes. Dabei analysieren sie einzelne Aspekte des  Phänomens, thematisieren Möglichkeiten der Einflussnahme von Investoren  auf Unternehmen und sprechen über Antworten der Regulatorik. Doch welche Möglichkeiten haben Investoren, den grünen Wandel  voranzutreiben? „In Deutschland liegt der Fokus sehr auf dem Management  mit Ausschlusskriterien“, sagt Aselmann. Nach Ansicht des Experten ist  dies zwar legitim, doch für die notwendige Transformation des  Wirtschaftssystems reicht es nicht aus. Vielmehr muss tiefergehend  analysiert werden, wo die Stellschrauben für die Veränderung liegen, so  der Experte. Welche Rolle dabei der sogenannte Engagement-Ansatz spielt und ob dieser  auch auf Staaten anwendbar ist, erfahren Sie im Video. ► Videopodcast bei YouTube: https://youtu.be/BuhnHljHFtk ► LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/mmwarburg ► Website: https://www.mmwarburg.de   Inhalt: 0:00 Einleitung 0:39 Gast Christian Aselmann 1:25 Aktuelles zum Thema Nachhaltigkeit 3:08 Waffen & Nachhaltigkeit 8:03 Nachhaltige Transformation durch Regulatorik & Investment? 12:17 Engagement & kritische Investments 16:14 Engagement durch Warburg 19:58 Engagement & Ausschlüsse bei Staaten 26:07 Stiftungen

Ein volkswirtschaftlicher Blick auf die Corona-Mutante Omikron und wie sie die Spielregeln ändert
Warburg Podcast
Die hochansteckende Omikron-Variante lässt weltweit die  Corona-Fallzahlen in die Höhe schnellen, jedoch scheinen die  Krankheitsverläufe in vielen Fällen etwas milder zu verlaufen als bei  vorherigen Varianten. Das hat Folgen für die Wirtschaft – aber auch für  die Debatte um weitere Corona-Schutzmaßnahmen wie der allgemeinen  Impfpflicht.  In unserem Podcast diskutiert Carsten Klude, Chefvolkswirt von  M.M.Warburg & CO, mit Peter Seppelfricke, Professor für Allgemeine  Betriebswirtschaftslehre, Finanzwirtschaft und Finanzdienstleistungen an  der Hochschule Osnabrück, über die Auswirkungen der Omikron-Variante  auf die Gesellschaft aus volkswirtschaftlicher Perspektive sowie über  die Verhältnismäßigkeit einer derzeit viel diskutierten Impfpflicht.  Dabei analysieren beide einzelne Aspekte des Themas, blicken auf  politische und wissenschaftliche Antworten und sprechen über aktuelle  Forschungsergebnisse und Studien zum Thema. Mit Verweis auf das Infektionsgeschehen in Ländern wie Südafrika,  England und Dänemark zeigt sich Professor Seppelfricke zuversichtlich:  „Es gibt Indizien, dass wir eine sehr steile Wand an Omikron-Infektionen  sehen werden, aber man könne bislang davon ausgehen, dass sie in  einigen Wochen auch wieder zurückgehen wird."" Das würde bedeuten, dass  das Gesundheitssystem in Deutschland nicht unter den rasant steigenden  Zahlen zusammenbrechen würde. So fordert Prof. Seppelfricke, die Politik  müsse über zusätzliche Schutzmaßnahmen wie etwa einer Impfpflicht  anhand einer umfassenden Kosten-Nutzen-Abwägung entscheiden. Doch was bedeutet das für die geplante allgemeine Impfpflicht? Braucht  es eine solche schwerwiegende und umstrittene Maßnahme dann wirklich  noch? Darüber und über weitere Fragen diskutieren die beiden Experten im  Video. 📺 Auch bei YouTube: https://youtu.be/ax-ErOr7-kI    ► LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/mmwarburg    ► Website: https://www.mmwarburg.de 0:00 Intro  0:09 Entwicklung von Omikron  7:07 Maßnahmen  15:25 Impfpflicht

Maschinelles Lernen im Portfoliomanagement – Fluch oder Segen?
Warburg Podcast
Das Thema Künstliche Intelligenz polarisiert. Für die einen stellt sie die endgültige Entmündigung des Menschen durch den Roboter dar, andere hingegen versprechen sich von ihr eine Verbesserung von Entscheidungsgrundlagen. Fakt ist, künstliche Intelligenz wird in Zukunft unsere Welt maßgeblich beeinflussen. Doch stellt sie auch einen Mehrwert für das Portfoliomanagement dar? In unserem Podcast diskutiert Dr. Christian Jasperneite, Chief Investment Officer von M.M.Warburg & CO, mit Professor Dr. Wolfgang Drobetz von der Universität Hamburg über die Vor- und Nachteile von maschinellem Lernen im Bereich des Portfoliomanagements. Beide analysieren dafür einzelne Aspekte des Phänomens, diskutieren über unterschiedliche wissenschaftstheoretische Standpunkte und blicken auf aktuelle Forschungsergebnisse und Studien zum Thema. Doch was ist eigentlich maschinelles Lernen? Und worauf zielt es ab? „Maschinelles Lernen stellt eine Unterform der künstlichen Intelligenz dar. Dabei erhält der Computer möglichst viele Daten, um daraus zu lernen. Konkret bedeutet das, dass er sich die Fähigkeit aneignet, Daten zu strukturieren und Muster in ihnen zu erkennen, um letztendlich in der Lage zu sein, eine Prognose treffen zu können“, erklärt Professor Dr. Drobetz. Dabei sucht der Algorithmus nach Mustern, was in den Wirtschaftswissenschaften nicht unumstritten ist. Dr. Jasperneite bringt die Kritik auf dem Punkt: „Als Ökonom interessiere ich mich eher für Kausalitäten. Maschinelles Lernen arbeitet jedoch mit Korrelationen.“ Folglich sind dynamische Prozesse damit schwer abbildbar. Doch trotz der wissenschaftstheoretischen Kritik gibt es viele Einsatzmöglichkeiten. „Stichwort Big Data. Maschinelles Lernen ist sinnvoll, wenn eine große Menge an Daten vorliegt, die ich als Mensch gar nicht strukturieren bzw. beurteilen kann. Mit Hilfe des Algorithmus können die Daten strukturiert werden, sodass eine Prognose abgeleitet werden kann“, sagt Prof. Dr. Drobetz. Welchen Mehrwert maschinelles Lernen besonders bei der Portfoliosteuerung bietet und warum gerade die Corona-Krise für KI-basierte Fonds ein Problem darstellt, erläutern die beiden Experten im Video. 📺 Auch bei YouTube: https://youtu.be/jeTtUToH31g ► LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/mmwarburg ► Website: https://www.mmwarburg.de 00:00 Vorstellung Prof. Dr. Drobetz 00:20 Einführung in das Thema 02:15 Exkurs Wissenschaftstheorie: Deduktivismus versus Induktivismus 07:44 Grenzen des induktiven Lernens 09:25 Korrelation versus Kausalität 12:08 Lucas Kritik 13:50 Vorteile des maschinellen Lernens 21:00 Mensch versus Maschine 22:10 maschinelles Lernen in der Portfoliosteuerung 25:15 Fazit 28:58 Ausblick

Retail-Investoren und ihre neue Lust am Aktienmarkt
Warburg Podcast
Seit Beginn der Corona-Pandemie stürmen Retail-Investoren an die Börsen  und mischen mit ihrem Verhalten die Märkte auf, was bei vielen  institutionellen Anlegern für Kopfschütteln sorgt. Dabei greifen  besonders junge Investoren auf technische Hilfsmittel wie Trading-Apps  oder Informationen aus den sozialen Medien zurück mit dem Ziel, schnelle  Gewinne mit nur wenigen Klicks zu erreichen, ohne viel Vorwissen  mitzubringen. Dass sie dabei mittels Kaufabsprachen über Internetforen  zum Schreckgespenst von institutionellen Investoren werden können,  zeigte unter anderem der Fall des US-Unternehmens GameStop. Doch welche  Folgen zieht dieser Trend nach sich? Und ist er überhaupt nachhaltig? In unserem Warburg Podcast diskutiert Dr. Christian Jasperneite, Chief  Investment Officer von M.M.Warburg & CO, mit Prof. Dr. Henning  Schröder von der Universität Hamburg  über die Frage, inwieweit Innovationen in den letzten Jahren im Kontext  von sozialen Medien zu einer Verhaltensänderung von Retail-Investoren  geführt haben. Dabei analysieren sie einzelne Aspekte des Phänomens,  thematisieren mögliche negative Folgen und sprechen über aktuelle  Forschungsergebnisse zum Thema. „Grundsätzlich lässt sich feststellen, dass Investoren Informationen aus  Sozialen Medien aber auch Empfehlungslisten von Onlinebrokern  verarbeiten und basierend auf diesen handeln. Daraus folgt, dass Aktien,  die in Foren oder Empfehlungslisten von Onlinebrokern häufiger erwähnt  werden, auch vermehrt gehandelt werden“, sagt Prof. Schröder. Welche  Auswirkungen das auf das Verhalten bzw. die Investorenperformance hat,  ist in der aktuellen Forschung strittig. „Am Beispiel des Forums  WallStreetBets lässt sich jedoch feststellen, dass grundsätzlich  Handlungsempfehlungen nicht zu abnormalen Negativ –oder abnormal  Positivrenditen der Retail-Investoren führen“, erklärt der Experte. Welche Folgen die neue Lust von Retail-Investoren am Aktienmarkt für die  Effizienz von Märkten hat? Ob vielleicht sogar regulatorische Maßnahmen  notwendig sind und was sogenannte SPACS damit zu tun haben, erfahren  Sie im Video. ► LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/mmwarburg ► Website: https://www.mmwarburg.de ► YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBI9umy6UYU Inhalt: 00:00 Vorstellung Prof. Dr. Schröder 01:13 Einführung in das Thema 02:32 Verhaltensänderung aufgrund von sozialen Medien 05:40 Auswirkungen auf die Investorenperformance 07:42 Effizienz von Märkten 09:15 predatory trading 15:05 Regulatorik 18:55 negative Effekte auf die Performance 21:07 Erstinvestoren 23:46 SPACS 27:42 Konstruktion von SPACS  33:26 Attraktivität von SPACS für Zielunternehmen

Dividendenrendite – ein Selbstläufer?
Warburg Podcast
Gerade in Zeiten von Niedrigzinsen suchen Anleger nach sicheren  Alternativen und so rückt die Jagd nach dividendenstarken Aktien wieder  in den Fokus. Von der regelmäßigen Ausschüttung durch die Unternehmen  versprechen sich Anleger einen kontinuierlichen Einkommensfluss, ohne  selbst groß aktiv werden zu müssen. Doch ist eine hohe Dividende  wirklich ein Selbstläufer? Und welche Fallstricke sollten Anleger  beachten? In unserem Podcast diskutiert Carsten Klude, Chefvolkswirt von  M.M.Warburg & CO, mit Professor Dr. Peter Seppelfricke von der  Universität Osnabrück über die Frage, warum die klassische Kennzahl der  Dividendenrendite trügerisch ist, und er Anlegern empfiehlt, das  Dividendenwachstum verstärkt zu berücksichtigen. „Die Dividendenrendite ist eine sehr statische Kennzahl. Die jetzige  Dividende wird im Verhältnis zum jetzigen Kurs gesetzt,“ sagt Professor  Seppelfricke. Es handelt sich folglich um eine Momentaufnahme, die dazu  führt, dass Unternehmen durchs Raster fallen, deren Dividenden über die  Zeit spürbar gewachsen sind. Ein weiterer entscheidender Punkt, der bei der klassischen  Dividenderendite nicht berücksichtigt wird, bezieht sich auf die  Haltedauer der Aktien. „Die meisten Anleger halten ihre Aktien für einen  längeren Zeitraum als ein Jahr. Entscheidend ist somit nicht, welche  Dividende ich jetzt bekomme, sondern welche ich zukünftig erhalten werde“, betont der Experte. Weshalb er bei der Suche nach  aussichtsreichen Aktien neben der Haltedauer auch das Dividendenwachstum  einkalkuliert. Zu welchen Erkenntnissen Professor Seppelfricke dabei bezogen auf  deutsche und amerikanische Unternehmen gekommen ist und welche Branchen  besonders vielversprechend erscheinen, erfahren Sie im Video. ► LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/mmwarburg ► Website: https://www.mmwarburg.de
