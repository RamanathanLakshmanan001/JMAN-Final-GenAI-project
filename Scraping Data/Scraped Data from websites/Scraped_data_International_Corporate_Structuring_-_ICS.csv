  Welcome to the IBSA Newsletter 
  IBSA News
Hot off the press: The Principles of International Tax Planning by Roy Saunders and IFS Consultants.

The book has undergone significant restructuring and development since it was first published in 2005. The principles are brought to life through a case study of a fictitious family with an abundance of personal and corporate tax issues.

The book is aimed at multi-disciplinary practitioners, such as accountants, bankers, lawyers, tax advisers, IP specialists, corporate finance advisers and managers of trust companies, as well as students who will benefit from studying The PITP, either in depth or as a useful reference book.The book is free to IBSA members – who will receive their copy shortly by post – and £95 to non-members.

Launch after launch – strength to strength

1 October: Hosted by the Malta Institute of Management, the launch of the IBSA in Malta included a seminar on a multi-disciplinary approach to international business structuring compliant with international transparency, corporate governance and social responsibility.

8 October: The launch of the North American Branch took place at Thomson Reuters’ Times Square offices in New York. Leading industry experts discussed issues such as US CFC legislation, holding companies, corporate re-domiciliation,  inversions and the impact of the OECDs BEPS initiative on transfer pricing.
UK Branch Meeting - 16 September

Knowledge Bank article – Fiduciary Relationships in International Business Structuring

This was the fourth event in the UK Branch programme of activities. Whilst fiduciary relationships were the focus of the evening, the panel also discussed issues relating to the exchanges of information that are available to government authorities in different jurisdictions, in particular, how exchange of information regimes are developing in response to the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) initiative introduced by the US, and how disclosure, or indeed nondisclosure of information, can determine the outcome of family law cases.

The concept of beneficial ownership was also addressed as a common and related misconception on the part of clients: that a trust or corporate entity, established for the purposes of exploiting a particular tax treaty or ring-fencing personal assets, will withstand the scrutiny of a tax administration or family law court.

Read the full summary of the 16 September UK Branch discussion group on the IBSA Knowledge Bank.

New York Panel Discussion - 8 October

In addition to launching the IBSA in North America, our recent event in New York played host to a panel discussion on US corporate inversions. Bernhard Gilbey of Squire Patton Boggs, Robert Kiggins of Culhane Meadows and Saumyanil Deb of Thomson Reuters discussed the key issues under scrutiny in the US at present.

Robert Kiggins opened the discussion by referring to the disparity of US corporate tax rates with the rest of the world. With the nominal federal corporate tax rate of 35% plus state taxes, and, for those operating in New York City, city taxes as well, the overall corporate tax rate can easily rise to the mid-forties. This can be compared to the forthcoming 20% corporate tax rate in the UK and 12.5% in Ireland. Add to that the fact that the US does not have a territorial tax system, and it is therefore no wonder that US corporations are looking to reduce their corporate tax bills.

Read the full summary on the IBSA Knowledge Bank.

WHAT IS THE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STRUCTURING ASSOCIATION?
The International Business Structuring Association (IBSA) is the worldwide community for practitioners dealing with international business structuring and regulatory compliance. The IBSA supports companies and advisors in obtaining information and advice worldwide to create and maintain sustainable business structures compliant with international transparency, corporate governance and social responsibility.
WHAT DOES THE IBSA DO FOR ITS MEMBERS?  
The International Business Structuring Association (IBSA) organises and runs multiple events and local meetings for its members across the globe, connecting diverse professionals involved in all aspects of business structuring. It provides members with a community and platform to build and cement strong professional reputations and relationships both across borders and within jurisdictions as well as providing an integrated knowledge base enabling members to connect with fellow professionals with specific areas of expertise worldwide.
THE VISION BEHIND THE IBSA
To create an international organisation with branches throughout the world dedicated to advancing the practice of international business structuring across multiple disciplines.
  To professionalise the practice of international business structuring.
  To create a community where professionals at all levels learn from each other and have access to worldwide knowledge and contacts opening up professional and commercial opportunities for all.
  To promote the practice of international business structuring as transparent, effective and professional without the aggressive tax connotations currently perceived by the public.
WHY WAS THE IBSA FOUNDED?  
“The pace of globalisation particularly at the entrepreneurial and medium sized enterprise level, coupled with the growth of the BRIC economies and emerging markets has led to massive growth in the number of companies trading and operating in multiple jurisdictions.
Running businesses in a cross border environment has never been easy but the international regulatory environment is now undergoing greater changes than ever before. Governments around the world pushed by the competing voices of public opinion, austerity, revenue retention and the need to grow their economies are both tightening regulations and cross border reporting whilst legislating incentives and treaties designed to attract and stimulate business in their own jurisdictions at an increasing pace.
Structuring companies to thrive and endure in this new international environment now requires a large breadth of disciplines and specific local knowledge with advisors increasingly needing to work in concert with groups of trusted fellow professionals worldwide
The International Business Structuring Association has been founded to provide a vehicle for this community of international advisors and their clients to access and exchange knowledge, develop new and deeper professional relationships and discover new business opportunities - I do hope that you will join me on this exciting journey.”
-        Roy Saunders, Chairman and Founder

WHAT IS THE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STRUCTURING ASSOCIATION?
The International Business Structuring Association (IBSA) is the worldwide community for practitioners dealing with international business structuring and regulatory compliance. The IBSA supports companies and advisors in obtaining information and advice worldwide to create and maintain sustainable business structures compliant with international transparency, corporate governance and social responsibility.
WHAT DOES THE IBSA DO FOR ITS MEMBERS?  
The International Business Structuring Association (IBSA) organises and runs multiple events and local meetings for its members across the globe, connecting diverse professionals involved in all aspects of business structuring. It provides members with a community and platform to build and cement strong professional reputations and relationships both across borders and within jurisdictions as well as providing an integrated knowledge base enabling members to connect with fellow professionals with specific areas of expertise worldwide.
THE VISION BEHIND THE IBSA
To create an international organisation with branches throughout the world dedicated to advancing the practice of international business structuring across multiple disciplines.
  To professionalise the practice of international business structuring.
  To create a community where professionals at all levels learn from each other and have access to worldwide knowledge and contacts opening up professional and commercial opportunities for all.
  To promote the practice of international business structuring as transparent, effective and professional without the aggressive tax connotations currently perceived by the public.
WHY WAS THE IBSA FOUNDED?  
“The pace of globalisation particularly at the entrepreneurial and medium sized enterprise level, coupled with the growth of the BRIC economies and emerging markets has led to massive growth in the number of companies trading and operating in multiple jurisdictions.
Running businesses in a cross border environment has never been easy but the international regulatory environment is now undergoing greater changes than ever before. Governments around the world pushed by the competing voices of public opinion, austerity, revenue retention and the need to grow their economies are both tightening regulations and cross border reporting whilst legislating incentives and treaties designed to attract and stimulate business in their own jurisdictions at an increasing pace.
Structuring companies to thrive and endure in this new international environment now requires a large breadth of disciplines and specific local knowledge with advisors increasingly needing to work in concert with groups of trusted fellow professionals worldwide
The International Business Structuring Association has been founded to provide a vehicle for this community of international advisors and their clients to access and exchange knowledge, develop new and deeper professional relationships and discover new business opportunities - I do hope that you will join me on this exciting journey.”
-        Roy Saunders, Chairman and Founder
