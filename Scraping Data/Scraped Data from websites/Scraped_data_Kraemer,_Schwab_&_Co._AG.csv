Long-term Value Investing
A passion for Value
We provide asset and fund management for private clients. By looking through this website, you will learn about our Value Investing philosophy and the people behind our company. We also encourage you to read about the timeless principles that govern our long-standing successful investment style. We have been Value Investors ever since our company was founded in 1983. It is our only business and it is how we invest our own money.
Value Investing
It is our belief that the market is at times inefficient: occasionally, stock prices reflect investors' sentiment rather than a company's economics. Over time, inefficiencies are corrected and prices realign with intrinsic values. Value investors seek to buy companies whose shares appear underpriced relative to the underlying fundamentals. Often, such stocks are characterized by high dividend yields and low price-earning-ratios. The discount of the market price to the intrinsic value constitutes a margin of safety. We try to invest in outstanding companies at sensible prices rather than in average companies at bargain prices. Strict discipline, patience, and focus on long-term absolute returns are key tenets of our approach.
Contrarian Investing
Most investors look favorably upon stocks rising in price and reject those falling. This conventional model causes them to overlook quality companies whose prices have fallen in overreaction to events that are transitory in nature. We emphasize fundamental economics over common opinions and try to think independently and long-term rather than letting herd behavior and short-term psychology cloud our judgement. Not always, but often, this makes us acting contrarian to the broad mass of market participants.
Long-Term Perspective
We employ a long-term investment strategy, buying carefully selected stocks. Once bought, we are not concerned about short-term price movements and technical indicators. We view stocks as fractional ownerships in businesses: once we have purchased interests in exceptional companies at reasonable prices, staying with our investments for a long time allows us to profit from the growth of their cash flows.
Independence
We have been an independent partnership since our incorporation in 1983. Such a structure provides stability, continuity and long-term focus, in perfect alignment with our investment philosophy.

Investment Philosophy
Valuation
Our investment process is centered around the fundamental valuation of businesses. Valuation marks the cornerstone of our analysis, investment decisions, portfolio construction, and risk considerations.
Invest into businesses
Rather than following a top-down approach formulating opinions on currencies, interest rates or economies, we analyze individual businesses bottom-up from an entrepreneurial point of view, company by company. We seek to buy above-average businesses, run by prudent management, at below-average prices.
Buy at a discount, have a margin of safety
When investing we allow for a «margin of safety» by buying into securities at prices below their intrinsic value. This provides us with some degree of protection even if things do not go our way.
Stay within our circle of competence
We only enter competitions in which we think we are strong and where we have a proven track record. What we do not understand, we will not buy.
Avoid permanent capital losses
Risk management, for us, is not about reducing price volatility. Rather, it is about the avoidance of permanent capital losses (defined as the loss of capital over a full investment cycle). Permanent capital impairment can occur if a business is fundamentally deteriorating, dangerously leveraged, or bought at an excessive price.
Think long-term
Investing is a marathon rather than a sprint. We trade short-term temptation for long-term opportunities. Our time horizon is long-term, i.e. 3-5 years and longer, not months.
Stay away from the herd
We do not follow the herd which applies optimism at the top and pessimism at the bottom. Instead, we strive to maintain independent, original thinking.

Investment Philosophy
Bonds
While stocks have greater potential whenever they are available at reasonable prices, we also like bonds for their steady cash flow which lends stability to a portfolio.
When investing into bonds, we follow a long-term perspective as well. If we find the yield attractive and the quality acceptable, we keep the debentures without worrying unduly whether rates are moving up or down. We invest often into sovereign and company bonds whose risks are temporarily overrated and shunned.
We are convinced that the investor who adheres to sound principles and has enough patience will be eventually rewarded by above-average returns. Money will be a by-product of a job properly done.

Investment Philosophy
Stocks
When we invest into stocks, we invest in businesses represented by stocks. We try to select good businesses with excellent economics, run by prudent management teams.
Ideally, we want to stay with them for a long time and participate in their growth and prosperity. The market price of the stock is there only as a reference point to see if anybody is offering to do anything foolish, either to pay a price that is too high or to offer the stock well below its intrinsic value.
We have to be skilful enough to understand and evaluate a business better than the market does, otherwise we don’t belong in the game.
Beside the analytical skills we have to be patient. Many people do not have the temperament to buy undervalued stocks because it requires so much patience. Every day, the market offers you investments at varying prices. You wait and refuse, wait and refuse until you are sure that you buy a bargain. They are most often found in those areas that are out of favour with the majority of investors. It will take time and discipline for a security selling below its true value to be recognized and increase in price.
It is important that the client is patient and confident too and let the investments work out without forcing the investment manager into unproductive action. Less is more.

We primarily process the personal data that we receive from you as an employee, job applicant, business partner, customer or interested party and that we need to achieve the purposes set out in section 3 of this Privacy Policy (e.g. first and last name, address, email address, telephone number, function, application documents and other information relating to you that you provide to us verbally or in writing). We may also obtain data about you from publicly accessible databases (e.g. commercial registers, social media platforms) or may receive such data from third parties, e.g. from your employer.
Insofar as this is permitted, we also obtain certain data from publicly accessible sources (e.g. debt collection registers, land registers, commercial registers, press, Internet) or receive such data from authorities and other third parties. In addition to the data that you provide to us directly, the categories of personal data that we receive about you from third parties include, in particular, information from public registers, information in connection with your professional functions and activities, information about you that people from your environment (family, advisors, legal representatives, etc.) provide to us so that we can conclude or process contracts with you or with your involvement (e.g. references, powers of attorney, information about your legal status, etc.). References, powers of attorney, information on compliance with legal requirements such as the fight against money laundering and export restrictions, information from banks, insurance companies, sales and other contractual partners of ours on the use or provision of services by you (e.g. payments made, purchases made), information from the media and Internet about your person (insofar as this is appropriate in the specific case, e.g. in the context of an application, customer acquisition, marketing, etc.).
Please note that you may only provide us with data from third parties (e.g. work colleagues or family members) if you have informed the persons concerned in advance about the processing by us by referring to this privacy policy. Finally, we would like to point out that our web server automatically logs every visit to our website in a temporary log file. User-specific data (e.g. browser information, IP) and technical data (e.g. name and URL of the referring website) are logged for the purpose of establishing a connection and optimizing your website visit, whereby we may also use so-called “cookies” (see section 5).
3.                  Purposes of Data Processing
We process your personal data primarily for the purpose of initiating and processing contracts with you (e.g. as a customer or employee) and/or with third parties (e.g. your employer as a service provider or business partner of ours). We also use your data to check and respond to your inquiries (or a job application) or to communicate with you in other ways (e.g. sending newsletters or responding to contact inquiries). We may also use your data for the following purposes:
Ensuring the availability and security of our website;
Improvement and further development of our services and website;
Compliance with legal and/or regulatory obligations, in particular anti-money laundering regulations;
Enforcement of or defense against legal claims in and out of court proceedings;
Protection of other legitimate interests;
Automated individual decisions.
We generally refrain from making automated individual decisions, i.e. decisions that are based exclusively on automated processing (without human influence) and that are associated with a legal consequence for you (e.g. refusal to conclude a contract) or that significantly affect you in some other way. Should we make such decisions in exceptional cases, you will be informed of this on a case-by-case basis.
4.                  Cookies
Cookies help in many ways to make your visit to our websites easier, more pleasant and more meaningful.

These cookies are temporary and are automatically deleted as soon as you close your web browser. Please note that deactivating cookies in this context may impair the functionality of the form and lead to restrictions in the user experience.
7.                  Google reCAPTCHA
To protect your requests and form submissions on our website, we use Google reCAPTCHA. This is a service provided by Google LLC, which serves to ensure that the input is made by a human and not abusively by automated, machine processing. reCAPTCHA uses cookies and other data such as your IP address to perform this analysis. This information is sent to Google servers and analyzed there.
Google reCAPTCHA cookies are necessary for the correct functionality of the security check and help to increase the security of the website for all users. The cookies are only stored for the duration of the current session and are automatically deleted when you close your browser.
As with other cookies, you can configure your web browser so that you are informed about the setting of reCAPTCHA cookies or completely prevent the storage of cookies. You can also activate the automatic deletion of cookies when closing the browser. Please note that deactivating these cookies could impair the functionality of the reCAPTCHA services and thus reduce the security of the website for you and other users.
8.                  Recipients of Personal Data
We may use external service providers to process your personal data. These recipients are checked by us with regard to compliance with data protection and are contractually obliged to process the personal data received exclusively in accordance with our instructions.
9.                  Disclosure Abroad
The recipients of your personal data named in section 8 are generally located in Switzerland or in the EU or EEA, but may in principle be located anywhere in the world.
If we transfer your personal data to a recipient in a country without adequate statutory data protection, we ensure adequate data protection by means of appropriate contracts (standard data protection clauses that have been approved, issued or recognized in advance by the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner [FDPIC]) and – where necessary – additional protective measures or rely on the statutory exceptions of consent, contract processing, the establishment, exercise or enforcement of legal claims, overriding public interests, published personal data or the need to protect your integrity.
10.              Storage Period
We process your personal data for as long as is necessary for the fulfillment of our contractual and/or legal obligations or otherwise for the purposes pursued with the processing, i.e. e.g. for the duration of the entire contractual or employment relationship (i.e. from the initiation, execution to the termination of the contract) as well as beyond that in accordance with any statutory retention and documentation obligations. It is possible that personal data may be stored for the period in which claims can be asserted against us and insofar as we are otherwise required to do so by law and regulation (in particular due to money laundering regulations) or our legitimate business interests require this (e.g. for evidence and/or documentation purposes). As soon as the purposes and/or laws no longer require it, your data will be deleted or anonymized.
11.              Data Secutity
We take appropriate security measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of your personal data, to protect it against unauthorized or unlawful processing and to counteract the risks of loss, unintentional alteration, unwanted disclosure or unauthorized access.
12.               Note on Consent and Your Rights
You can revoke any consent to the processing of your personal data at any time with effect for the future by writing to the address given in section 1.
You have the right to information, correction, deletion and disclosure of your personal data for the purpose of transfer to another body. Please note that we reserve the right to assert restrictions provided for by law, e.g. if we are obliged to store or process certain data, have an overriding interest in doing so or require it for the assertion of claims.
The exercise of your rights requires proof of identity (e.g. by presenting a copy of your ID). To assert your rights, you can contact us at the address given in section 1.
You have the right to enforce your claims in court or to contact the competent authority. The competent data protection authority in Switzerland is the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (http://www.edoeb.admin.ch).

Investment Philosophy
«Bottom-up» instead of «Top-down»
You may wonder why we do not pay much attention to business cycle analysis, why we do not recommend a top-down approach that is widely followed by institutional investors, banks, and the scientific world. In our opinion, it doesn’t work well. People who worry too much about the business cycle are usually not able to grab wonderful bargains when the market is giving them away. We prefer to acquire excellent businesses when the outlook is perceived to be clouded instead of buying mediocre businesses during periods of euphoria. The true investor has his best opportunities in uncertain times. One pays a high price for a cheery consensus (remember the Dotcom-Bubble, Japan in the 1990ies, the Gold-Boom in the early 1980ies!).
