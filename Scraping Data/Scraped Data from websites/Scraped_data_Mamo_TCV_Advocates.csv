GLOBAL NETWORKS
Powered by knowledge
World Services Group was created in 2002 and is a global membership network whose members are among the leading independent firms. Formed upon a unique approach to legal networks, WSG developed the idea that the premier independent law firm needed a more expansive and efficient global approach within the industry. The integration of knowledge, expertise and clients creates better opportunities for providers and clients alike. Additionally, through innovative access and technology, WSG offers members and clients immediate access to prospects, information, and leading experts with a known record of superior, quality service. WSG has been built on the expertise and experience of the over 23,000 professionals at its more than 120 member firms. WSG’s global representation includes more than 150 jurisdictions and operations throughout the United States and Canada.
The International Fraud Group began in London in 1997. Established by leading London firm, Mishcon de Reya, it was a specific response to a client’s needs. To recover assets stolen and spirited away into multiple jurisdictions. An alliance of law firms was created for the purpose. With devastating success. This one-off alliance has become a permanent global network.
Our Social Responsibility
As leaders in our field and an important point of reference for the country’s business community, we feel responsible to assist the community and protect the environment in as many ways possible.
The firm supports a number of NGOs in various ways that include charitable contributions, pro bono work and hands-on help at the premises of charitable institutions. We have recently pledged a number of pro bono hours to support refugees from Ukraine seeking asylum in Malta and different members of our team are providing weekly support to a local food bank.
We are also seeking to implement environmental and sustainable best practices in all aspects of our operations and have also undertaken various works and initiatives to reduce water and electricity consumption at our offices. The firm also regularly organises clean-ups and similar events which seek to play a part in the protection and embellishment of the environment.
Get in Touch
Diversity & Inclusion
We cannot prosper if we are all the same. Similarly, the requirements, expectations and cultures of our clients are not the same. As a result, cultivating and sustaining a diverse work environment and workforce, is critical to meeting the unique needs of our diverse client base.
To have the best people, we must look at the broadest pool of prospective candidates and across the full spectrum of race, colour, religion, sex, age, disability, sexual orientation and gender identity.
We seek to create an environment that encourages input from all perspectives and supports differences. This in turn places us in the best possible position to see the bigger picture and to offer advice that takes all that matters into account.
Of course, there is yet more that needs to be done, but we are proud of the inclusive and diverse working environment we have created and will keep working to build further on what we have already achieved.
