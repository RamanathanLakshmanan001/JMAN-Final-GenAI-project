IP anonymization
On this website, we have activated the IP anonymization function. As a result, your IP address will be abbreviated by Google within the member states of the European Union or in other states that have ratified the Convention on the European Economic Area prior to its transmission to the United States. The full IP address will be transmitted to one of Google’s servers in the United States and abbreviated there only in exceptional cases. On behalf of the operator of this website, Google shall use this information to analyse your use of this website to generate reports on website activities and to render other services to the operator of this website that are related to the use of the website and the Internet. The IP address transmitted in conjunction with Google Analytics from your browser shall not be merged with other data in Google’s possession.  
Browser plug-in
You do have the option to prevent the archiving of cookies by making pertinent changes to the settings of your browser software. However, we have to point out that in this case you may not be able to use all of the functions of this website to their fullest extent. Moreover, you have the option prevent the recording of the data generated by the cookie and affiliated with your use of the website (including your IP address) by Google as well as the processing of this data by Google by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available under the following link: https://tools.google.com/dlpag….  
Objecting to the recording of data

For more information about the handling of user data by Google Analytics, please consult Google’s Data Privacy Declaration at: https://support.google.com/ana….  
Contract data processing
We have executed a contract data processing agreement with Google and are implementing the stringent provisions of the Luxembourg data protection agencies to the fullest when using Google Analytics.  
Demographic parameters provided by Google Analytics
This website uses the function “demographic parameters” provided by Google Analytics. It makes it possible to generate reports providing information on the age, gender and interests of website visitors. The sources of this information are interest-related advertising by Google as well as visitor data obtained from third party providers. This data cannot be allocated to a specific individual. You have the option to deactivate this function at any time by making pertinent settings changes for advertising in your Google account or you can generally prohibit the recording of your data by Google Analytics as explained in section “Objection to the recording of data.”  
Archiving period
Data on the user or incident level stored by Google linked to cookies, user IDs or advertising IDs (e.g. DoubleClick cookies, Android advertising ID) will be anonymized or deleted after 14 month. For details please click the following link: https://support.google.com/ana…    
Google Analytics Remarketing
This website uses the functions of Google Analytics Remarketing in combination with the functions of Google AdWords and Google DoubleClick, which work on all devices. The provider of these solutions is Google Ireland Limited („Google“), Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.  
This function makes it possible to connect the advertising target groups generated with Google Analytics Remarketing with the functions of Google AdWords and Google DoubleClick, which work on all devices. This makes it possible to display interest-based customized advertising messages, depending on your prior usage and browsing patterns on a device (e.g. cell phone) in a manner tailored to you as well as on any of your devices (e.g. tablet or PC).  
If you have given us pertinent consent, Google will connect your web and app browser progressions with your Google account for this purpose. As a result, it is possible to display the same personalized advertising messages on every device you log into with your Google account.  
To support this function, Google Analytics records Google authenticated IDs of users that are temporarily connected with our Google Analytics data to define and compile the target groups for the ads to be displayed on all devices.  
You have the option to permanently object to remarketing/targeting across all devices by deactivating personalized advertising. To do this, please follow this link: https://www.google.com/setting….  
The consolidation of the recorded data in your Google account shall occur exclusively based on your consent, which you may give to Google and also revoke there (Art. 6, Sect. 1, lett. a GDPR). Data recording processes that are not consolidated in your Google account (for instance because you do not have a Google account or have objected to the consolidation of data), the recording of data is based on Art. 6, Sect. 1, lett. f GDPR. The legitimate interest arises from the fact that the operator of the website has a legitimate interest in the anonymized analysis of website visitor for advertising purposes.  
For further information and the pertinent data protection regulations, please consult the Data Privacy Policies of Google at: https://policies.google.com/te….  
Google AdWords and Google Conversion Tracking
This website uses Google AdWords. AdWords is an online promotional program of Google Ireland Limited („Google“), Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland. 
In conjunction with Google AdWords, we use a tool called Conversion Tracking. If you click on an ad posted by Google, a cookie for Conversion Tracking purposes will be placed. Cookies are small text files the web browser places on the user’s computer. These cookies expire after 30 days and are not used to personally identify users. If the user visits certain pages of this website and the cookie has not yet expired, Google and we will be able to recognise that the user has clicked on an ad and has been linked to this page.  
A different cookie is allocated to every Google AdWords customer. These cookies cannot be tracked via websites of AdWords customers. The information obtained with the assistance of the Conversion cookie is used to generate Conversion statistics for AdWords customers who have opted to use Conversion Tracking. The users receive the total number of users that have clicked on their ads and have been linked to a page equipped with a Conversion Tracking tag. However, they do not receive any information that would allow them to personally identify these users. If you do not want to participate in tracking, you have the option to object to this use by easily deactivating the Google Conversion Tracking cookie via your web browser under user settings. If you do this, you will not be included in the Conversion Tracking statistics.  
The storage of „Conversion“ cookies and the use of this tracking tool are based on Art. 6, Sect. 1, lett. f GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in the analysis of user patterns, in order to optimize the operator’s web offerings and advertising. If a corresponding agreement has been requested (e.g. an agreement to the storage of cookies), the processing takes place exclusively on the basis of Art. 6, Sect. 1, lett. a GDPR; the agreement can be revoked at any time.  
To review more detailed information about Google AdWords and Google Conversion Tracking, please consult the Data Privacy Policies of Google at: https://policies.google.com/pr….  
You can set up your browser in such a manner that you will be notified anytime cookies are placed and you can permit cookies only in certain cases or exclude the acceptance of cookies in certain instances or in general and you can also activate the automatic deletion of cookies upon closing of the browser. If you deactivate cookies, the functions of this website may be limited.  
Google DoubleClick
This website uses features of Google DoubleClick. The provider is Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA, (hereinafter „DoubleClick“).  
DoubleClick is used to show you interest-based ads across the Google Network. Advertisements can be tailored to the interests of the viewer using DoubleClick.  For example, our ads may appear in Google search results or in banners associated with DoubleClick.  
DoubleClick must be able to recognize the respective viewer in order to be able to display interest-based advertising to users. For this purpose, a cookie is stored in the user’s browser, behind which the websites visited by the user, clicks and various other information are stored. This information is aggregated into a pseudonymous user profile to display interest-based advertising to the user concerned.  
The use of Google DoubleClick takes place in the interest of targeted advertising measures. This constitutes a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6, Sect. 1, lett.  f GDPR. If a corresponding agreement has been requested (e.g. an agreement to the storage of cookies), the processing takes place exclusively on the basis of Art. 6, Sect. 1, lett. a GDPR; the agreement can be revoked at any time.  
You can set your browser so that it no longer stores cookies. However, this can restrict the accessible functions of websites. It should also be noted that DoubleClick may also use other technologies to create user profiles. Disabling cookies therefore does not guarantee that user profiles will no longer be created.  
For further information on how to object to the advertisements displayed by Google, please see the following links: https://policies.google.com/te… and https://adssettings.google.com….  
7. Newsletter  
Newsletter data
If you would like to subscribe to the newsletter offered on this website, we will need from you an e-mail address as well as information that allow us to verify that you are the owner of the e-mail address provided and consent to the receipt of the newsletter. No further data shall be collected or shall be collected only on a voluntary basis. We shall use such data only for the sending of the requested information and shall not share such data with any third parties.  
The processing of the information entered into the newsletter subscription form shall occur exclusively on the basis of your consent (Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. a GDPR). You may revoke the consent you have given to the archiving of data, the e-mail address and the use of this information for the sending of the newsletter at any time, for instance by clicking on the “Unsubscribe” link in the newsletter. This shall be without prejudice to the lawfulness of any data processing transactions that have taken place to date.  
The data deposited with us for the purpose of subscribing to the newsletter will be stored by us until you unsubscribe from the newsletter or the newsletter service provider and deleted from the newsletter distribution list after you unsubscribe from the newsletter. Data stored for other purposes with us remain unaffected.  
After you unsubscribe from the newsletter distribution list, your e-mail address may be stored by us or the newsletter service provider in a blacklist to prevent future mailings. The data from the blacklist is used only for this purpose and not merged with other data. This serves both your interest and our interest in complying with the legal requirements when sending newsletters (legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR). The storage in the blacklist is indefinite. You may object to the storage if your interests outweigh our legitimate interest.  
8. Plug-ins and tools  
YouTube with expanded data protection integration
Our website embeds videos of the website YouTube. The website operator is Google Ireland Limited („Google“), Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.  
We use YouTube in the expanded data protection mode. According to YouTube, this mode ensures that YouTube does not store any information about visitors to this website before they watch the video. Nevertheless, this does not necessarily mean that the sharing of data with YouTube partners can be ruled out as a result of the expanded data protection mode. For instance, regardless of whether you are watching a video, YouTube will always establish a connection with the Google DoubleClick network.  
As soon as you start to play a YouTube video on this website, a connection to YouTube’s servers will be established. As a result, the YouTube server will be notified, which of our pages you have visited. If you are logged into your YouTube account while you visit our site, you enable YouTube to directly allocate your browsing patterns to your personal profile. You have the option to prevent this by logging out of your YouTube account.  
Furthermore, after you have started to play a video, YouTube will be able to place various cookies on your device. With the assistance of these cookies, YouTube will be able to obtain information about our website’s visitors. Among other things, this information will be used to generate video statistics with the aim of improving the user friendliness of the site and to prevent attempts to commit fraud. These cookies will stay on your device until you delete them.  
Under certain circumstances, additional data processing transactions may be triggered after you have started to play a YouTube video, which are beyond our control. 
The use of YouTube is based on our interest in presenting our online content in an appealing manner. Pursuant to Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. f GDPR, this is a legitimate interest. If a corresponding agreement has been requested (e.g. an agreement to the storage of cookies), the processing takes place exclusively on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR; the agreement can be revoked at any time.  
For more information on how YouTube handles user data, please consult the YouTube Data Privacy Policy under: https://policies.google.com/pr….  
Google Web Fonts (local embedding )
This website uses so-called Web Fonts provided by Google to ensure the uniform use of fonts on this site. These Google fonts are locally installed so that a connection to Google’s servers will not be established in conjunction with this application.    
Google Maps (with consent)
This website uses Google Maps, a mapping/location service, via an API. The provider is Google Ireland Limited (“Google”), Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.  
To warrant data protection on this website, you will find that Google Maps has been deactivated when you visit this website for the first time. A direct connection to Google’s servers will not be established until you have activated Google Maps autonomously at your end (i.e. given your consent pursuant to Art. 6, Sect. 1, lett.  a GDPR). This will prevent the transfer of your data to Google during your first visit to our website.  
Once you have activated the service, Google Maps will store your IP address. As a rule, it is subsequently transferred to a Google server in the United States, where it is stored. The provider of this website does not have any control over this data transfer once Google Maps has been activated.  
For more information about the handling of user data, please consult the Data Privacy Declaration of Google under the following link: https://www.google.de/intl/de/…. 
Google reCAPTCHA
We use „Google reCAPTCHA“ (hereinafter referred to as „reCAPTCHA“) on this website. The provider is Google Ireland Limited („Google“), Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.  
The purpose of reCAPTCHA is to determine whether data entered on this website (e.g. information entered into a contact form) is being provided by a human user or by an automated program. To determine this, reCAPTCHA analyses the behaviour of the website visitors based on a variety of parameters. This analysis is triggered automatically as soon as the website visitor enters the site. For this analysis, reCAPTCHA evaluates a variety of data (e.g. IP address, time the website visitor spent on the site or cursor movements initiated by the user). The data tracked during such analyses are forwarded to Google.  
reCAPTCHA analyses run entirely in the background. Website visitors are not alerted that an analysis is underway. 
The data is processed on the basis of Art. 6, Sect. 1, lett. f GDPR. It is in the website operators legitimate interest, to protect the operator’s web content against misuse by automated industrial espionage systems and against SPAM.
For more information about Google reCAPTCHA please refer to the Google Data Privacy Declaration and Terms Of Use under the following links: https://policies.google.com/pr… and https://policies.google.com/te….    
9. Custom Services  
Job Applications
We offer website visitors the opportunity to submit job applications to us (e.g. via e-mail, via postal services on by submitting the online job application form). Below, we will brief you on the scope, purpose and use of the personal data collected from you in conjunction with the application process. We assure you that the collection, processing and use of your data will occur in compliance with the applicable data privacy rights and all other statutory provisions and that your data will always be treated as strictly confidential.  
Scope and purpose of the collection of data
If you submit a job application to us, we will process any affiliated personal data (e.g. contact and communications data, application documents, notes taken during job interviews, etc.), if they are required to make a decision concerning the establishment or an employment relationship. The legal grounds for the aforementioned are Art. 6, Sect. 1, lett. b GDPR (General Contract Negotiations) and – provided you have given us your consent – Art. 6, Sect. 1, lett. a GDPR. You may revoke any consent given at any time. Within our company, your personal data will only be shared with individuals who are involved in the processing of your job application.  
If your job application should result in your recruitment, the data you have submitted will be archived on the grounds of Art. 6, Sect. 1, lett. b GDPR for the purpose of implementing the employment relationship in our data processing system.  
Data Archiving Period
If we are unable to make you a job offer or you reject a job offer or withdraw your application, we reserve the right to retain the data you have submitted on the basis of our legitimate interests. The retention period is established according our internal “Data Retention” policies. Afterwards the data will be deleted, and the physical application documents will be destroyed. The storage serves in particular as evidence in the event of a legal dispute. In case you wish to learn more about our retention police, you can contact us at personaldata@lag.lu.  
10. E-Mail communication  
Information Provided as Mandated by Article 13 GDPR
If this is your first interaction with us, Art. 12, 13 GDPR mandates that we make available to you the following mandatory data protection related information: If you are contacting us via e-mail, we will process your personal data only if we have a legitimate interest in the processing of this data (Art. 6, Sect. 1, lett. f GDPR), if you have consented to the processing of your data (Art. 6, Sect. 1, lett. a GDPR), if the processing of the data is required for the development, establishment, content or modification of a legal relationship between you and our company (Art. 6, Sect. 1, lett. b GDPR) or if any other legal provision permits the processing of this data. Your personal data will remain in our possession until you ask us to delete the data or you revoke your consent to store the data, if the purpose the data stored is required for no longer exists (e.g. once your request has been conclusively processed) or if the established rentetion period is expired. This shall be without prejudice to any compelling statutory provisions – in particular tax and commercial law based retention periods. You have the right to at any time receive free information concerning the origins, recipients and purpose of your data archived by us. You also have a right to object, to data portability and a right to log a complaint with the competent supervisory agency. Moreover, you can demand the correction, eradication and, under certain circumstances, the restriction of the processing of your personal data. Our Personal Data Board can be reached at personaldata@lag.lu.

About us
The beginning
Over the past 175 years a lot of major decisions have been made that have shaped the future of tobacco production. One of these decisions has been the construction of a new, state-of-the-art factory in Fridhaff, in the north of the Grand Duchy, which was completed in 2019. This presented the opportunity to redevelop the abandoned areas in Hollerich and Ettelbruck. Landimmo Real Estate was founded in 2012 for this endeavor.
Today
Landimmo has grown steadily. When it was founded, the company employed just two people, and today it employs a team of thirteen people from a variety of fields.
We moved our offices at the end of 2022 to the Landewyck Building, which was the first project we renovated as part of the development of our new Parc Landewyck (Nei Hollerich) district. The building is also a winner of the Bauhärepräis OAI 2024 in the category « office/workplace building ».
Our philosophy
We insist on delivering a high standard of service to echo the corporate philosophy of the Landewyck Group. The key focus of our real estate business is to achieve long-term ROI and promote sustainable construction. Landimmo is customer service-oriented and has an open mindset with regards to employing and developing innovative solutions.
Jürgen Primm
CEO at Landimmo
We not only position ourselves as property developers, but also play a significant role in helping create and maintain a dynamic, sustainable neighbourhood.

Property management
Rental contract management, technical maintenance, invoicing.
Landimmo specialises in the daily oversight of commercial and industrial real estate. Our responsibilities include:
• screening potential tenants
• drafting, signing and renewing leases
• invoicing and collecting rent
• arranging repairs and maintenance
Today, our property management team is mainly involved in managing the buildings originally occupied by Landewyck Holding in Hollerich and Ettelbruck.
The real estate portfolio in Strassen comprises the former premises of the wholesale company Fixmer, with approx. 1 hectare of space. The factory buildings were taken over in 2013 and converted for a range of different tenants. Today, the 5,850 sqm site comprises rented warehouse space, offices, showrooms as well as a training centre and a gym. The Strassen site is managed by Industra, a wholly owned subsidiary of Landimmo.
In the medium term, the property management team will be expanded to additionally manage all real estate that is being redeveloped in Hollerich and which will remain within our portfolio. Our real estate portfolio will reach about 120,000 sqm gross floor area.
