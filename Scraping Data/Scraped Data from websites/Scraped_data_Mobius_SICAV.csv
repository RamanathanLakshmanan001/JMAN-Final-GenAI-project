https://mobiusinvestmenttrust.com/en/strategy,"STRATEGY
SUMMARY
MCP's investment philosophy is based on a forward-looking quality approach, focusing on innovative, lesser-known companies in emerging and frontier markets. The team seeks to identify companies with strong financial characteristics, sustainable earnings and competitive advantages. Rather than adhering to traditional value or growth classifications, MCP employs an unconstrained, benchmark-agnostic strategy known as Quality at a Reasonable Price (QARP).
This approach allows the team to identify and capitalise on unique investment opportunities across the market spectrum, typically targeting companies with market capitalisations ranging from $400 million to $20 billion.
MCP's investment philosophy emphasises active ownership, working closely with company management to drive operational and sustainability improvements with the aim of driving re-ratings and unlocking additional sources of alpha.

https://mobiusinvestmenttrust.com/en/esg,"ESG+C®
SUMMARY
MCP's investment philosophy utilises an active ownership approach with an emphasis on improving ESG-standards. We do not constrain ourselves to conventional definitions of 'ESG' but also place a heavy emphasis on rigorously assessing corporate culture (ESG+C®) as academic research suggests that companies with strong cultures outperform their peers over the long term (see MCP’s 2022 Culture Report).
Unlike many investors who seek companies already excelling in ESG, MCP targets those with the potential to become sustainability leaders within their sectors. This ESG+C® framework is built on two key pillars:
1.
Integration of Material ESG+C® Factors at Research Stage: As part of our comprehensive research process, we focus on understanding each company’s existing ESG+C® practices to provide targeted guidance for improvement. By assessing key areas—such as sales practices, energy efficiency, environmental impact, diversity, decision-making, and innovation—we create a materiality-based roadmap to help enhance their ESG performance.
2.
Active Ownership and Engagement: Following investment, MCP works closely with each portfolio company to elevate their ESG+C® standards, supporting them in their journey toward sustainability leadership and adaptation to evolving ESG expectations. Our engagement is highly tailored, involving consistent, meaningful interactions throughout the holding period, including face-to-face meetings, video calls, and ongoing correspondence.
''We are not looking for today's ESG champions but are actively engaging with tomorrow's sustainability, governance and operational leaders.''

FOOTNOTES
1.
The Engagement breakdown is for Q4 2024 and is based on 189 engagements in the fields of Environment, Social, Governance, Culture and Operations and Capital Allocation issues.
2.
As part of the ESG+C assessment four different dimensions are assessed: Environmental: entails factors like climate change, natural resources, pollution & waste as well as environmental opportunities; Social: refers to factors such as human capital, product liability, and social opportunities; Governance: refers to the reporting methods, the ownership structure as well as checks and balances; Culture: contains factors like the degree of freedom, equality, recruitment, innovation, and remuneration.
3.
Portfolio companies are assessed on a binary basis whether they do or do not comply with the assessed metric. The number of companies complying with the metric is expressed as a percentage of the portfolio.
4.
The determined company percentages are weighted according to their weight in the portfolio. The weighted average is reported as a percentage of the portfolio.
5.
External CDP Score: The Carbon Disclosure Project increases environmental transparency and accountability of companies and enables progress tracking. The scoring ranges from A, A- to B. B- to C, C- to D, D- and F.
6.
Sustainable Development Goals: Out of the 23 portfolio companies reporting on the United Nations sustainable development goals, the top 3 goals are selected.
7.
Founder/Family-Owned Companies: Reports the percentage of portfolio companies with the family or founder holding 5% or more.
8.
Blockinvestor: Refers to an individual or organisation owning a substantial amount of the company’s shares. The hurdle rate is set at 15%.
9.
Dedicated Investor Relations Professional: Reports companies as a percentage of the portfolio having appointed an employee responsible for investor relations.
10.
Dedicated Sustainability Professional: Reports companies as a percentage of the portfolio having a dedicated employee in charge of the company’s sustainability activities.
11.
External Glassdoor Score: Glassdoor is one of the world’s largest job and recruiting sites providing scores for companies ranging from 0 to 5. The Portfolio score is the average of 29 available scores among the portfolio.
We rely on the data provided by portfolio companies which is not necessarily reliable and gathered/verified on a best-efforts basis. Information from companies is only considered if it is publicly available and traceable to the source. Accordingly, we avoid private questionnaires or surveys as such a process is difficult to replicate on a quarterly basis. Based on this principle, annual reports are one of the central data sources. Quantifying qualitative data helps to evaluate the overall portfolio and provides comparable data.
