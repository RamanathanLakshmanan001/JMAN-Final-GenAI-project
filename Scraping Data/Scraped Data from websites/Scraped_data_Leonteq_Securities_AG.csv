ESG Rating Performance
We are committed to operating responsibly and we recognize the growing importance of ESG and responsible investment.
Sustainable finance in general – and the sustainability credentials of financial products such as structured products– have become increasingly important to institutional and private investors. As a provider of investment solutions, Leonteq is in the process of developing a responsible investing methodology to assess the sustainability of structured products. As part of these efforts, we are engaged in active discussions with relevant industry associations in Switzerland and Europe to agree on a common denominator when it comes to determining sustainability features in structured products.

USA: Has the Trump put run its course?
Donald Trump is serious: the USA wants to levy additional tariffs of 25% on the price of every imported car. “They will go into effect April 2, we start collecting April 3,” the US president said when signing the relevant order. At the same time he repeated the accusation that the United States was being ripped off, the piggy bank that other countries were stealing from. “It’s the start of liberation day in America”, Trump enthused. Not only are the new charges intended to flush billions into government coffers and thereby help to reduce taxes and pay off debt, but the Republican is also predicting a rosy future for US industry.
