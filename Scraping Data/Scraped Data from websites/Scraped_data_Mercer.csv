Successful M&As require integration planning
Driving value across all transaction types
Our focus
Heightened competition means buyers often have to commit without performing adequate due diligence, mitigating risk, determining compliance issues or fully developing post-merger integration plans. Mercer’s project management operations (PMO) approach combines world-class process management with real-time consulting. The result is the rapid identification and mitigation of risk.
Workforce strategy
Determine critical roles and the talent needed to drive success. Formulate workforce strategies to address any gaps.
Operating model
Develop your future strategy and operating model, including organisation design, governance and decision rights.
Talent assessment, retention and onboarding
Maximise deal success by assessing talent, identifying and selecting leaders, and retaining critical skill sets.
Change management and communication
Conduct change management planning and integration focused on moving key stakeholders from both entities.
Culture
Identify cultural risks to deal objectives, and build a comprehensive integration strategy and operating environment.
Talent insights
Implement an AI-based approach to understand skills, identify risks and retention implications pre-close, and develop post-close talent strategies.

Workforce & organisation transformation
Rethink and reorganise work
Digitalisation and new work options like gig workers and internal talent marketplaces are presenting us with opportunities to re-envision work. Do you have the necessary tools?
How can we build a workforce strategy for an unknown future? 
The emergence of new business models has created opportunities for many sectors to change how they operate — automating jobs and creating new opportunities for the entire talent ecosystem. As work roles are reconfigured to embrace AI and robotics, organisations must rethink the critical skills they need and build talent platforms that provide maximum agility.
#1 people priority in business? Defining future workforce needs and/or restructuring.
Prepare for the future of work
Respond proactively to the new opportunities, and redesign jobs for an optimised and sustainable combination of human and automated work. Designing for the future is not hard with Mercer’s proven methodology and innovative AI-driven digital platform.
Deconstruct jobs
Analyse the tasks and activities that underpin jobs and workflows.
Identify tasks that are best suited for automation or redeployment to alternative talent.
Redeploy tasks
Determine which task delivery can be enhanced through automation or other means including gig work, internal talent marketplaces, outsourcing, shared services and more, and understand the impact on your organisation.
Reconstruct work
Create new jobs and workflows based on the new work options.
Discover the skills you need for more efficient and sustainable operation.
Download the brochure for more details
How do you get to the desired state?
To break out of the rigidity of existing organisational structures, leaders must reassess and craft new operating systems. These should support work transformations that better enable agility, fluidity and sustainability. This involves:
Starting with the work (current and future tasks), not with existing jobs
Combining people and automation
Considering the full array of work arrangements (such as full-time employment, gig and freelance working, alliances, joint projects and other alternatives)
Allowing talent to “flow to work” rather than being dedicated to fixed, permanent jobs

Recognition
Mercer Work Design: 2023 HR Tech Award winner
HR Tech has recognised Mercer Work Design as a 2023 award winner of Best Advance in Practical AI: solution that leverages AI, machine learning, robotic process automation, and/or natural language processing for practical impacts to people and the business in the category of Talent Analytics.
“With so many employers looking to adopt a skills-first approach, many of them are realising that it's incredibly difficult to go beyond jobs to granular skills insights for decision-making purposes. To solve that, Mercer Work Design helps employers to deconstruct, analyse, and reconstruct jobs down to the fundamental skill level. Mercer's global expertise in workplace trends, skills and other areas makes this a tremendous offering for future-focused employers."" 
- Ben Eubanks, Chief Research Officer, Lighthouse Research & Advisory
Why Mercer?
We deliver hypothesis-driven and evidence-based transformation, underpinned by industry benchmarks and deep analytics to demonstrate the return on investment. Our approach has a number of advantages over traditional and emerging competitors.
Human-centred and empathetic. We believe transformation only works when it’s people-centred. Empathy is our core competency for activating each and everybody for the change.
Senior adviser guidance. Our senior consultants observe, listen and challenge the status quo. They guide by leveraging decades of experience and globally recognised thought leadership.
Enablement for self-sustainment. We become an integral part of your team, activating people around us. Working closely together, we transfer knowledge and digital assets while building the capabilities you need for a successful and sustainable journey beyond our engagement.
Radically rethink and reinvent work design
Become skills focused and future ready
Work has changed dramatically over the decades. Status quo is no longer working — and it no longer has to, if leaders are ready to radically rethink the way work is performed.

Talent assessment challenges
How do we understand the skillset of the talent we have today?
What roles do we need for the future, and what skills are required for these roles?
Where are the gaps, and how do we fill them?
How do we ensure our talent strategy is sustainable and future-proofed?
What is the most efficient way to build, buy or borrow talent?
How do we identify and retain high-potential talent?
How do we help our talent feel supported in their career growth?

How can we tell if our managers have an inclusive leadership style?
How do we build a culture of feedback to support performance management?
Aligning talent with dynamic business needs 
When talent is scarce, people development, upskilling and reskilling become the keys to organisational competitiveness and sustainability. Upskilling, reskilling and flexibly deploying skills are only possible if jobs are deconstructed into skills. Skills are the new currency of work. Skills flexibility provides business resilience and agility.
Mercer’s talent assessment solutions evaluate the current state of your internal labour market and quantify the talent gaps needed to future-proof the business. Mapping and analysis can help you focus on critical populations to answer essential questions about the potential for talent supply and demand in your organisation. Future projections can then model how specific initiatives may be able to support your goals.
We can help an organisation deliver on their reskilling strategies and investments by reflecting them in the broader talent management strategy, including learning and development, performance management, and total reward practices with pay-for-skills and pay-for-development innovations.
As organisations pursue workforce transformation, they are constantly looking for talent that can adapt to the rapid changes in the skills they demand while anticipating and planning for the skills they will need as they transform. 
Disruptors are changing the job landscape
Change is here. Consider AI and automation, globalisation, the gig economy and multiple generations working together and the impact on your organisation. How will you adapt to the shifts?
98%
of companies have significant skills shortages despite 91% of employees reporting learning a new skill in the last year.
1 in 3
executives says the pandemic helped them realise that knowing what skills they have in their workforce improves their agility. 
92%
of HR leaders are prioritising improving their workforce planning to better inform buy/build/borrow talent strategies

Our approach to talent assessment
Mercer proposes a strategic and integrated assessment approach. This means considering the different phases of the talent management strategy and integrating them in a continuous iteration process that places people at the centre in relation to business needs and corporate strategies. This process feeds the pipeline for current and future critical skills and roles and directs resources toward targeted growth, allowing you to steer your company toward success.
We leverage data and analytics to measure individual and organisation success. Our strategic and integrated approach consists of four main steps:
Embark Discover Shape Drive
Phase: Envision and articulate the future vision of skills Phase: Understand the current state through research insights and benchmarks  Phase: Create bold solutions with measurable outcomes toward the future state skill vision Phase: Deliver sustainable results and bake the skill transformation into the fabric of the organisation
Focus: What's the real business challenge we're trying to solve with this shift – from an employer and an employee perspective? Focus: Where is the work going right and wrong from a productivity and an employee experience perspective? Focus: What changes to work will simultaneously improve productivity and the employee experience of work? Focus: How do we create a way of working that’s productive, compelling and sustainable?

Embracing the differentiated needs of a diverse, multigenerational workforce, and using the relevant employee engagement mechanisms for each
Understanding individual employee experiences and categorising those experiences into personas
Having mechanisms in place to enable individuals to voice their preferences 
Holistically addressing employee needs with a more nuanced and flexible approach
Considering all perspectives: personas, organisational needs, industry standards, regulatory landscape, competitor offerings, cost, and societal values
Formulating a rewards programme that harmonises with your other employee value proposition (EVP) offerings, and 
Assimilating the latest compensation data, employee research and workplace insights so you can build what works.
This new world order – one that is more nuanced and personalised – requires new organisational skills of listening, learning and adapting to identify and address unmet needs.

Reshaping work and people experiences
Transformation is not a one-time event. Achieving bold, systemic change requires investing in your people to drive long-term, sustainable growth that realises returns in multiple dimensions — financial, operational and human. 
There are a number of challenges organisations can encounter on their journey:
Redesigning work to achieve an optimal combination of people and automation
Implementing strategic workforce planning best practice that delivers value to the business
Overcoming deficiencies in workforce capability and future skills
Applying new ways of working — supporting flexibility for the business and the individual
We enable companies to unlock future growth by helping them reimagine how they work and how their people experience work. Our approach to strategic workforce planning is people-centric and evidenced-based. Based on world-class thought leadership and practical experience, we will help you build solutions that add value, eliminate friction and engage your workforce.
We will underpin your on-going transformation with our proven change management support. This will enable you to understand, acknowledge and address the varying needs of your managers and employees. In turn, this will drive greater commitment and adoption.

Job Architecture: Building structure into an evolving world
It’s an employee-centric environment. To achieve optimal internal equity and external competitiveness, it’s essential to establish a robust career architecture framework with consistent job analysis and job evaluation methodology.

A staggering 81% of employees feel at risk of burnout this year (up from an already concerning 63% in 2020). They say the top reason for burnout is not feeling sufficiently rewarded for their efforts.
Mercer Global Talent Trends 2022
Job architecture = a consistent baseline and a career progression framework
Unfairness – whether real or perceived – particularly in base pay and rewards, is a key factor in employee disengagement.
A job architecture with clear job analysis and evaluation can help mitigate that risk. Job architecture provides a consistent and transparent framework for development activities and career paths for all employees in your organisation. It is the baseline for fair and equitable enterprise-wide job and title evaluation, which are essential in successful reward and development programmes.
A global job architecture is important, because:
It enables organisations to offer a seamless employee experience throughout the entire employee-life cycle, including individual and targeted development and learning activities, transparent and sustainable career paths, and succession planning.
HR can use it to provide predictive people analytics to the business, taking a major step towards strategic workforce planning.
It enables future job analysis, development, and evaluation.
It is a foundational platform for effective attraction, development, and retention of business-critical talent.
Organisations are able to comprehensively understand the internal comparability and external value of jobs.
It increases workplace flexibility.
HR can have immediate, easy access to every role in the organisation.
After M&A – job architecture enables HR to quickly provide the business with the most effective model of the future organisation – based on optimal numbers of levels, impactful career paths, and consistency in job evaluations. 
Mercer’s International Position Evaluation (IPE) and Career Framework are two key elements in a successful job architecture.

Mercer IPE is an essential element of any job architecture 
Mercer IPE is a proprietary global job evaluation methodology based on a series of business-related factors and dimensions that represent core job attributes.
Application of the IPE methodology provides an organising framework based on a job's value within the context of an organisation – and the wider commercial environment.
IPE implementation follows a simple process focusing on organisation structure, the complexities of the business, and the alignment of jobs to the business.
To find out why Mercer IPE is essential to your job architecture, contact our specialists today.
Career progression frameworks play a critical role in talent and succession
In a world filled with opportunities, how do you ensure talent chooses you, and then choose to stay with you?
One of the drivers of resignations is that people don’t see long-term career progression in their organisation or see better external options. This risk can be managed with a strategic career framework.
Compelling internal professional development and career pathways form a critical part of talent attraction and retention. Not only does a well-designed and publicised career progression framework attract new talent, but it also allows your people to grow and thrive with you – creating engaging employee and experiences.
Career frameworks also enable better strategic workforce planning, and faster internal backfilling of business-critical roles by mapping all possible career paths to each role.
When viewed in such a light, a career progression framework should sit at the core of every HR strategy, touching on all workforce initiatives. Yet, our research shows that, surprisingly, only one in two companies have a career framework. The absence of one is likely posing challenges for attraction, retention, and internal backfilling of business-critical roles. Other common problems we see include:
Lack of information
Even in organisations with formal career progression frameworks, career path information is often not readily available and career conversations are not happening regularly enough. More needs to be done to help employees recognise the compelling opportunities that exist within their own organisations to build their career, including frequent conversations with their manager to help brainstorm possible career moves, and strategise how to build their skill set.
No structural support
In some organisations, there are distinct discrepancies between business units when defining their job and career architecture. The vast majority are reactively creating new job levels and/or adding steppingstone roles, frequently, there are also regional variations.
Career progression frameworks need to be intentionally designed at micro and macro levels. In this talent demand economy, the onus is on the organisation – and direct managers – to architect and inspire career experiences and paths that have intentional and meaningful movement.
One-size approach no longer works
Organisations need to be aware of, and work with, their employees’ experience and expectations. In this era of the individual, just as employees expect to have a lot more agency about where, when, and how they work, they also want to be fully informed about their choices for career development and advancement.
Because great career opportunities drive talent retention. Let your people grow with you.
A career framework is a strategic centrepiece that sits at the core of every HR department and touches on all workforce initiatives, yet surprisingly, only one in two companies have a career framework. This is at odds with the 70% of companies who report confidence in filling their critical roles internally. 
Compelling careers are built by career path frameworks
Become the source of the talent you need by creating a career framework.
Find out what development means to your employees 
Start by asking your employees what a compelling career looks like from their perspective. What skills and experiences do they value? What growth opportunities are they seeking? By finding out what your workforce wants, you can create careers that combine their interests with the needs of your organisation.
Design high impact careers using real career paths
Intentionally design the Transparency, Control and Velocity of career paths to fulfil both your organisation’s need for a ready-now skills pipeline as well as your employees' need to feel they are advancing at the right pace.
Institutionalise a career culture
Using technology to ensure career information is easily accessible. Facilitate movement and career progression by recognising non-lateral career moves, celebrating learning rather than just promotions, and rewarding high potentials with more meaningful career experiences.
Make careers engaging and fun 
Invest time in ensuring managers see employee career development as central to their roles. Equip people managers with talking points on how to lead career conversations effectively with the stated objective of showing employees that your organisation is one in which they can grow and thrive.
We help you ensure your career framework engages and inspires your people – so they pursue their professional progression inside your organisation.

Talent & rewards
Maximise engagement with tailored reward and recognition
The world's largest and most comprehensive employee compensation resource
As employers grapple with stagflation, pandemic recovery, remote working, and the labour shortage, how much to pay your employees has never been more delicate nor complex. More than ever, the quantity and quality of the employee compensation information you use are critical.
Mercer has the world's largest and most comprehensive workforce rewards data – so you can always be sure you are making the right remuneration decisions.

Making employee compensation decisions in complexity
It’s a complicated time to attract and retain talent. When it comes to employee compensation – a fundamental tool in the workforce rewards toolbox – there are now arguably more factors to consider than at any other time:
How do you know you are paying fairly across your geographically diverse locations?
Are you over- or under-paying against industry standards?
How do you balance market-wide wage stagnation with compensating becoming a resignation impetus?
How do you assemble the elements you need to build a market-leading employee rewards programme?
When is the right time to do an employee compensation audit?
Can you justify your employee compensation decisions?
What does a good employee compensation strategy look like now?
Given all the factors in flux, do you need the expertise of a compensation consultant?
The global talent scarcity means your compensation plans need not only to be robust, but stand out – locally, regionally, and across the world.
Mercer can partner with you to answer all these critical questions and more with our total remuneration data, and consultant services. 
Employee compensation data from over 45,000 participating organisations worldwide, including more than 20 million incumbents, referencing 400,000 roles.

Reframing competitive employee experience
Adapt the employee experience to the new shape of work and rapidly evolving employee expectations.

It’s time to reframe the employee experience
Employee experience was already a trending topic before the pandemic.
However, the pandemic caused people to rethink their priorities and has brought organisations and people closer together. The three over-arching aspects of employee experience — employee expectations, the environment and moments that occur in an employee’s journey — have not changed, but the pandemic brought new questions into focus:
How to make flex working work
How to hire, onboard and manage/coach employees with a dispersed or virtual workplace
How to work, collaborate and communicate in distributed or virtual networks
How to move from offering well-being policies to actively partnering with employees in their health and wellness
How to create a frictionless digital work environment to ensure new technology supports work rather than hindering it — and that people enjoy interacting with the technology
Managing the employee experience just got more nuanced. In an increasingly employee-centric market and a world offering highly personalised experiences, more and more people want to tailor their own work and craft schedules that work for them.
People no longer want to work for a company; they want to work with them. This signals an urgent need to differentiate the employee experience to attract and retain top talent — 85% of companies are co-creating employee experiences with their people (GTT 2022).
Co-creation is an important aspect as employees’ work-related needs and desires vary based on their:
Gender
Generation
Job level
Caregiving status
And their needs and experience are not constant; shifting as different parts of an employee’s life change — work, personal, financial, and health and well-being. Considering the whole person and dynamically adjusting to employee needs requires a strategic yet nuanced approach. It also requires gaining actionable insights on an ongoing basis, at the right time. This is just one key dimension to building a stronger workforce and a human-centred, technology-enabled, consumer-grade employee experience.
Text description
How can you create a personalised employee experience that people crave?
High-performing employees want their employee experience to be:
Enriching
Efficient
Embracing
Empathetic
But a one-size-fits-all approach won’t work. Having a robust strategy and governance framework, employee listening and data insights, capabilities and communications, and digital tools in place to support a personalised employee-experience will be key. Doing this can create a competitive advantage. Our research shows that agile companies are twice as likely to say they have made great inroads in creating, and continue to experiment with, a positive employee experience (Global Talent Trends 2022) — one that is aligned with the employee value proposition and digital transformation ambitions.
Mercer can help you create a personalised, technology-enabled and consumer-grade employee experience with:
Employee listening
Employee value proposition strategy 
total rewards assessment and design (including rewards, benefits and wellness)
Employee communications
Flexible working strategies
Design-thinking workshops
Technology implementation
Persona and journey mapping
Organisational culture assessments
How far along are you in shaping a compelling and personalised employee experience? Mercer can support you in understanding your employees’ needs and drive positive business outcomes by:
Measuring what matters
Delivering people insights
Designing change and action
Moving from insights to impact

A fundamental change in people’s values is underpinning a structural shift in the labour market. Organisations now have a moment of profound opportunity to pick up the tools of empathy honed during the pandemic — and carve a new way of partnering that is more relatable and, ultimately, more sustainable.

MMB health trends 2023 
The top trends shaping employer-provided healthcare
MMB’s Health Trends global survey of 226 insurers across 56 countries identified five key themes driving costs and risks in employee health benefits.
Five key trends
Top trends driving the future of employer-provided healthcare
Per-person medical cost
Per-person medical cost increases are back to pre-pandemic levels. 68% of insurers expect plan sponsors to prioritise design improvements despite forecasted double-digit medical trend rates in some markets.
Claims experience
COVID-19 continues to impact claims experience. 55% of insurers report an increase in later-stage diagnosis of illness due to deferred care.
Plan modernisation
Plan modernisation has begun. 1 in 2 insurers has changed or expects to change eligibility requirements and eligible expenses to make coverage more inclusive for those who identify as LGBTQ+.
Mental health gaps
Mental health gaps persist. 16% of insurers report not providing plans that cover mental health services (versus 26% in 2022).
Plan management
Plan management requires greater rigour. More than 1 in 5 insurers in Asia are adjusting medical plan premiums based on COVID-19 vaccination status.
These trends are important for employers to consider as while many firms have latitude in designing their benefit plan to meet their needs, insurers play a key role in shaping the benefits landscape. They do this through their standard practices and policy language, their willingness to adopt new provisions, and their access to large pools of claims data.

Benefits in 2025
Total Rewards is not rewarding unless it includes a compelling set of benefits. Organizations have always looked at benefits as a balancer to the compensation offered. Post pandemic, benefits and well-being have taken a different dimension and have been looked at from a perspective of VOI (value of investment). With Gen Y and Gen Z dominating the workforce and having different life stage expectations personalization has become inevitable. Everything cannot be personalized and some need to be uniform and standard. The standardization is essential to ensure life and health contingencies are not compromised. Hence organizations need to get a perfect balance between personalization and standardization.

People sustainability
Create positive impact through ESG and sustainability 
Organisations are committing to greater purpose, taking immediate, bold and sincere action to move the needle on sustainability goals. 
Around the world, investors, employees, customers and activists expect organisations to transform their operations around a pressing priority: environmental, social and governance (ESG) sustainability. 
To satisfy these stakeholders, organisations are striving to become sustainable at their core. This means leaders should articulate their organisation’s purpose, agree on ESG commitments, initiate a culture change that embraces sustainability, invest responsibly and seek out suppliers that align with their goals. To hold leaders accountable, some organisations are embedding sustainability into the business scorecard and tying compensation to ESG results, with a growing focus on social sustainability. They’re setting reportable goals and tracking their progress on sustainability.
Environmental sustainability is widely known, and many organisations are already working to reduce their carbon footprints. For the governance facet of ESG, executives are watching out for risks and adhering to regulations. 
Now, social sustainability is taking centre stage as stakeholders expect employers to take better care of their workforces and tend to their people’s financial, physical and mental health. This extends to fair treatment of external workers and alignment with responsible supply chain partners.  
Conscientious organisations are taking immediate, bold and sincere action to move the needle on sustainability goals. And it’s paying off as they gain a competitive advantage, increase sales, lower costs, and attract and retain critical talent.

A deeper dive into ESG and sustainability
Embedding sustainability with an ESG scorecard
As organisations strive for sustainability at the core, ESG scorecards offer accountability and results.
Ensuring sustainability at the core
Organisations want and need to ensure sustainability is at the heart of business transformation — from company purpose, work standards and investment strategies to circular economy aspirations, environmental impact and supply chain standards.

Preparing for the future of work 
Uncover how organisations are seizing the opportunity to redesign work, working and the workplace.
Focusing the discussion on work-life balance and the need for talent to own their own reskilling journeys misses the broader transformation that needs to occur.
Ravin Jesuthasan
Global Transformation Services Leader, Mercer
Living in a heightened risk environment — where risks and opportunities intersect in unexpected ways — is the new reality. A fundamental change in people’s values is underpinning a structural shift in the labour market.
Continued turbulence impacts ambitions
The strained supply chains and geopolitical conflict of the last two years remain. So do concerns over inequality, slow progress on social justice and the decarbonisation agenda that is currently slated for a disorderly net-zero transition. Market gyrations and inflation concerns also continue as views diverge over whether to take bold action and how to mitigate risk.
We have all learnt lessons from the pandemic — the fingerprints of which are evident in executives’ plans for business resilience and recovery. In the event of another economic downturn, C-suite executives plan to make strategic investments instead of merely cutting costs as they did when the pandemic first hit. Mercer’s 2022 Global Talent Trends Study reveals an interesting comparison to the last time executives had to contemplate an impending downturn:
Fewer plan to leverage variable staffing models (down from 39% in 2019 to 29% today).
Fewer plan to reduce headcount (down from 30% to 26% today).
This reflects a pandemic-era lesson — that companies can be more nimble in difficult times by retaining people who know the culture and are already committed to the journey — and acknowledges the unique challenges of a tight economic climate combined with a hot labour market.

A more sustainable, consumer-grade digital employee experience
As they prepare for the future of work, most organisations have already embarked on their digital transformation journeys. This digital journey accelerated exponentially as the pandemic rapidly pushed processes online and into the cloud. In response, leading employers are adding new digital platforms for everything from connecting and collaborating at work to accessing benefits and digital health solutions. 
Expectations are high. Organisations must be strategic and make sustainable, consumer-grade choices precisely aligned with their business and people strategies. Leading with a digital-forward employee value proposition not only helps companies stay agile, it also provides a better-quality employee experience overall — helping to attract and retain talent. And while many employees are digital-ready, others will need support in adapting to these new technologies.
Adapt to a new work operating system
The impact of technology acceleration on the future of work has been profound. At the same time, we have experienced the democratisation of work opportunities. To navigate the rapidly evolving world of work, policymakers, leaders, managers and workers require a “new work operating system” that unhooks workers and workforce capabilities from traditional job boundaries.
Organisations need to design well-being and learning into the flow of work.
Ravin Jesuthasan
Global Transformation Services Leader, Mercer
Investing in total well-being
When asked to describe the future of work, one in three employees says it is about equity. They expect employers to move from merely offering benefits to being active partners in people’s health and wealth outcomes — such as ensuring access to high-quality healthcare (where gaps still exist today, especially in emerging markets), having a contingency for those in financial crisis or helping to close pension deficits.
The focus on outcomes broadens the discussion to include the social determinants of health. Such nonmedical factors often hinge on unmet needs, the aspects of an individual’s living and working environment that cause stress or poor health — such as debt, savings gaps, precarious healthcare access, or limited child or elder care, as well as basic needs like housing, food and transportation. Addressing the whole person’s needs is crucial to driving health outcomes across the diverse populations that make up the workforce — and it shows the company truly cares.
It is clear that health and total well-being have become more central to the debate on the future of work.

Mercer Marsh Benefits
A world of benefits, built around you.
For multinational organisations navigating the complexities of local legislation, customs, vendors and relationships, it can be hard to see your way ahead to a globally-consistent programme. Mercer Marsh Benefits helps you unlock a simpler way to manage your programmes both globally and regionally.

How multinational HR teams can gain from global benefits management
Do you know what you’re currently spending each year on benefits?
Managing HR in an organisation with thousands of employees across multiple countries is extremely complex.
You need to make sure you have the right data and insights to demonstrate your programme’s ROI. Getting this right leads to better governance, risk management, cost containment and employee engagement.
Global benefits management offers multinational organisations an effective way to manage insured employee benefits around the world. Global or regional arrangements offer visibility, control, cost savings and ensure consistency in governance, while delivering solutions that are based on local country needs.
Do you have the right benefits to attract and retain key talent?
The right global benefits management programme for your organisation is one that is built around you. Your industry, your structure, your locations, your people.
As employers expand their operations globally, they need to look at the scope and level of benefits they provide for their increasingly diverse and mobile workforces. This includes understanding the range of health and well-being risks present in each location and their impact on employee productivity and engagement.
Global employee benefits to help you compete locally
The cost pressures on multinational businesses are growing. For many benefits are a major outgoing, comprising around 20% of total payroll costs. This could rise significantly, driven by escalating medical trend rates.
On top of this, substantial resources are spent tracking, renewing, tendering, and benchmarking insured benefits around the world.
Many organisations pay the price for a fragmented, multi-national approach to benefits broking. In fact, 81% of multinational benefits leaders say ‘global consistency’ is their number one priority according to MMB's Benefits Tech Trends report.
Firms urgently need to find efficiencies by harmonising and managing benefits collectively. This means developing a strong global structure, with the ability to tailor benefits for simple and agile local execution and employee engagement.
A Global Benefits Management (GBM) approach simplifies this process, streamlining administration, boosting value for money, and making sure that programmes provide measurable return on investment.
The five main advantages of a GBM approach are:
Using digital solutions that give you real-time insights
How to embark on a successful global benefits management journey
Manage risk
You can’t manage what you can’t see. We give you a clear view of your risks, and ways to manage them. To cover your benefits, to comply with local legislation, to navigate increasingly complex risk and exposure of plans, to reduce risk and increase employee productivity through automation. And to use benefits to manage the greatest risk of all: not attracting the best and brightest people to your business.
Control costs
Globally, medical inflation and claims are on the rise, with more than half of markets seeing medical trend rates above 10% in 2024 and 2025. If you don’t have visibility of your costs, you can’t stop them escalating. We help you map and analyse your costs: to find efficiencies, to optimise spend, to use data from your programme to negotiate hard. When you can see your spend, you can use your size – and leverage our networks and experience – to strike better deals. On average, we save multinationals 10-15% on global and regional benefits premiums*.
* Source: MMB Global Benefits Management Analytics - An average saving of 10-15% of premiums demonstrated over a three-year term following the introduction of a new global benefits management programme in a non-pandemic year.
Optimise your financing strategy
We give you visibility of your global benefits spend, help you set a budget and finance it, making the most of your size and economies of scale. From insurance to self-insurance or captive set-ups, we’ll help you finance your programme in the way that’s right for who you are – and where you are on your benefits journey.
Improve well-being
When your people are all over the world, it can be hard to get a view on their well-being. We help you build strategies and programmes that translate into healthier, more engaged employees, as well as lower premiums. We help you understand what you have in place; help you listen to employees and understand what it is they truly need; and help you set a strategy that delivers on those needs, everywhere.
How Mercer Marsh Benefits can help
We can help you design, build, finance, automate and manage your global or regional programme to attract and keep top talent.
We meet you where you are on your journey, and bring vertical sector expertise and benchmarking, local insights from 150+ countries, new ideas and new ways of working.

Due to cost pressures, shifting employee needs and a rapidly evolving global environment, designing, delivery and financing employee benefits is becoming increasingly complex.
Employee benefits strategy and consulting
Our employee benefits solutions include plan strategy and design, brokerage services, employee benefits analytics and insights, employee communication and financial and actuarial services.
The changing nature of work, war for talent and ongoing health risks, requires competitive employee benefits solutions that meet ever-shifting employee needs. Our employee benefits consulting services are underpinned by deep expertise on the employee benefits landscape, data-driven benchmarking and modelling tools and decision-making approaches to ensure your programme is competitive and affordable.
With the insight on what’s driving claims, your employee benefits consultant will work with you to minimise risk, manage overall spend and contain costs. Not only by harnessing our strong relationships with insurers to secure favourable terms, but by also helping you to prioritise plan design, health risk management, financing, administration, vendor management and governance changes. Our benefits administration systems and benefits communication services can help you further increase your return on investment.
Employee benefits solutions
Whatever your employee benefits needs, our innovative end-to-end services can help you every step of the way. Whether you are a small business, large multinational or global firm, our experienced consultants will work in partnership with you, to tailor your programmes to the unique needs of your business and deliver the following range of comprehensive employee benefits solutions. 
Employee benefits plan strategy & design
We apply a considered approach to helping you articulate your programme objectives and benefits roadmap. Whether your focus is reducing costs, competing in the war for talent or boosting employee wellbeing, we’ll ensure your benefits programme is fit for purpose.
Employee benefits broker services
Our market-leading employee benefits brokerage services can help you secure the right benefits solutions at the right price. We’ll also offer suggestions for smarter benefits that reduce your risk profile and claims to keep plans sustainable. 
Employee benefits analytics & insights
If you want to improve well-being, manage costs or retain employees, robust employee benefits analytics will inform strategic thinking. Our market-leading tools help you harness your employee benefits data.
Employee benefits communication
The right benefits communication strategy will boost employee engagement, helping you to attract and retain talent. Our end-to-end employee benefits communication solutions include branding, messaging and communication tools.
Small business employee benefits
Our employee benefits for small businesses bring you the best value deals from health insurance and group benefits providers. These are designed to help you attract and retain the talent needed to grow your business and keep your people healthy.
Finance & actuarial
Cost management of benefits plans is being pushed up the corporate agenda, making it the ideal time for employers to begin thinking about long-term cost forecasting and containment strategies. For self-insured and/or post-employment benefit programmes, we will help you meet accounting obligations.
Engaging employee benefits solutions
Workforces everywhere are increasingly multigenerational, diverse and global. Our Health on Demand research found that the more varied the benefits you offer, the more loyal, engaged and energised your workforce will become.
Critical to meeting these demands, is introducing automated benefit admin solutions. Not only does this reduce the administration burden on teams, but digital tools enable programmes to be tailored to employees’ unique needs and interests.
Our employee benefits consultants, with deep expertise at both a global and local level, are not tied to any specific solutions. This means we can help you build a strategy and select the programmes and vendors that are right for you, wherever you’re based.  
Employee benefits solution challenges
Navigating the increasingly complex world of employee benefits, people risk and employee benefit cost management, requires addressing the following issues. 
1. Managing the cost of employee benefits solutions
2. Automating employee benefits administration
3. Reducing sickness absence and health claims
4. Supporting employee attraction and retention
5. Boosting productivity and performance
Employee benefits solutions you can trust
MMB is at the forefront of delivering employee benefits consulting to inform your employee benefits strategy. Our employee benefits solutions give you access to an experienced team of brokers and consultants that will take the time to understand your business, as well as respond to requests and provide information needed to inform decisions, be this locally, regionally or globally.

Talent & rewards
Executive compensation is increasingly complex
Designing competitive executive compensation and policies that align with business strategies while incentivising top talent can be challenging.
We help you factor in all the critical considerations, so you can achieve the most compelling and effective executive compensation and reward plans.

To remain competitive, organisations must attract key executive talent, motivate and reward appropriate performance, and create an alignment with business imperatives and other talent strategies.
Our market-leading executive compensation and rewards consulting solutions
Mercer have the world’s richest compensation databases to support you when determining the most effective executive compensation, and we go beyond data.
Our collaborative executive compensation consulting combined with our databases help you shape and implement your executive compensation programmes.
We know one size does not fit all, and help organisations determine compensation levels that align with their strategic talent needs and relevant talent comparators.
Mercer advisers achieve measurable impacts on performance, efficiency, sustainability, and risk management by developing cash and equity compensation programmes that serve the interests of executives, owners, and the organisation while managing the growing complexity of regulations, legislation and stakeholder demands.
Multiple viewpoints
We consider shareholder, board member, company, employee, and any other stakeholder perspectives while reflecting both external and competitive realities.
Current metrics
We understand the full spectrum of deliverables expected of today’s executives. Our metrics drive financial performance, operational excellence, governance, and meaningful sustainability initiatives. We help you to customise rewards in purpose-driven ways.
Attract and motivate executive talent
Having the right leaders for your organisation might be the most critical driver of success. Mercer can help you design executive compensation plans that attract, retain, and motivate the critical global and local executive talent you need for long-term organisational excellence. While:
Aligning pay with your organisation’s strategic needs and relevant talent comparators,
Realising the value in ownership transactions, and
Staying compliant with regulatory, legislative, and shareholder requirements and guidelines.
The most comprehensive market data – customised
We utilise executive compensation market data from all relevant sources, including Mercer’s flagship Total Remuneration Survey, to meet your needs. We custom-design survey instruments and analytics on the specific issues that concern you.
Objectivity
We have established global business standards to manage potential conflicts of interest inherent in advising boards of directors and management on executive rewards issues.
Societal expectations about executive compensation drivers are evolving
Along with the conventional goals of executive compensation packages: attract key talent, motivate appropriate performance, and align with business imperatives, many organisations are beginning to reflect broader stakeholder concerns into consideration, including:
Operating sustainably, including improving diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI)
Take actions to support environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) initiatives, and
Embracing a stakeholder (rather than a stockholder) mindset.
Mercer’s executive compensation consultants are trusted advisers to public- and private-company senior management and boards of directors. Our executive compensation plan professionals provide best-in-class expertise in the areas of executive and director compensation and benefits, sustainability metrics, pay-performance alignment, and corporate governance.
There is now increased pressure for organisations to contribute to the broader world in a way that reflects the values of their customers, employees and investors.

Mercer Cookie Notice 
Effective Date: December 22, 2022
We use cookies and related tracking technologies, including web beacons, tracking pixels and log files (collectively referred to as “cookies”) on this website to distinguish you from other users, assess and improve functionality of the website and our services, and provide you with a good experience. 
WHAT IS A COOKIE
Cookies are pieces of information shared between your web browser and a website. Some cookies are necessary for making the website work.  Some help us assess and improve its performance.  We also use cookies to help provide relevant content, products and services to you.  A cookie cannot read data from your computer's hard drive.
There are different kinds of cookies with different functions:
(i) Session cookies: these cookies are only stored on your computer during your web session. They are automatically deleted when the browser is closed.  They usually store an anonymous session ID allowing you to browse a website without having to log in to each page. They do not collect any information from your computer.
(ii) Persistent cookies: these cookies are stored as a file on your computer and remain there when you close your web browser. They can be read by the website that created them when you visit the website again.
(iii) First-party cookies:  these cookies are created by our company. They are stored and sent between our servers and your computer’s hard drive.  These cookies may be either Session or Persistent cookies.
(iv) Third-party cookies: these cookies are created by one of our third-party partners. They are stored and sent between the third-party’s server and your computer’s hard drive. These cookies are usually Persistent cookies.
HOW AND WHY WE USE COOKIES
Depending on the website, we may use cookies for the following purposes:
Where Strictly Necessary
These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around the website and use its features, such as accessing secure areas of the website. Without these cookies, services you have asked for, such as obtaining a quote or logging into your account, cannot be provided. These cookies do not gather information about you that could be used for marketing or remembering where you have been on the internet.
Functionality
These cookies allow our website to remember choices you make (such as your username, language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced features. For instance, a website may be able to remember your log in details, so that you do not have to repeatedly sign-in to your account when using a particular device to access our website. These cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to text size, font and other parts of web pages that you can customise. They may also be used to provide services you have requested such as viewing a video or commenting on an article. The information these cookies collect is usually de-identified. They do not gather any information about you that could be used for advertising or remember where you have been on the internet.
Analytics
These cookies collect information about how visitors use a website, for instance which pages visitors go to most often, and if they get error messages from web pages. They also allow us to record and count the number of visitors to the website, all of which enables us to see how visitors use the website in order to improve the way that our website works.
Advertising
These cookies are used for the purpose of displaying advertisements that will be relevant to you and for managing the performance of advertisements. Advertising cookies are generally third-party cookies and may be present even if there is no advertising in use on the website.
IP Addresses
When you visit our website, we may collect your Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses to track and aggregate non-Personal Information. For example, we may use IP addresses to monitor the regions from which users navigate the website.
HOW TO MANAGE COOKIES
Please click the ""Manage Cookies"" link at the bottom of the page to opt in or out of certain cookies using our Cookie Consent Manager.  Note that it is not possible to opt out of Strictly Necessary Cookies, so websites that only use such cookies may not provide this link.
Visit the “Help” section of your browser for how to manage your cookie settings.
COOKIE NOTICE DOES NOT COVER THIRD PARTY WEBSITES
When we include links to other websites, please bear in mind they will have their own privacy and cookie policies that will govern the use of any information you submit.  We recommend you read their policies as we are not responsible or liable for their privacy practices
CHANGES TO THE COOKIE NOTICE
We may update this notice occasionally and we encourage you to review the policy from time to time to stay informed of how we are using cookies.  We post the effective date of the policy at the top of the page.
DESCRIPTION OF COOKIES USED
Please click on the ""Manage Cookies"" link in the footer of the website to find details about the individual cookies used on the website.  This link may not be available if we only use Strictly Necessary Cookies on the website.

People Risk 2022 
Find out how managing people risk across five key pillars can build business and human resilience.
Our People Risk research looked at the individual people risks with the most power to disrupt business, to identify the top 25 people risks across five pillars of people risk management.
Critical to mitigating these risks is recognising that while people are an organisation’s most important strength, they can also bring significant risk.
Instead of reacting to unfolding events, HR and Risk must now collaborate to mitigate people risks linked to health and safety, ESG and the future of work. This requires putting a proper foundation for risk management in place, including proactive measures to protect employees.
See below for our People Risk research highlights and download the full report for detailed insights on managing people risk.
The five pillars of people related risks in an organisation
Our global survey of over 2,300 Human Resource and Risk Management professionals identified five pillars of people risk. Highlighting the extent to which enterprise risk management is evolving to encompass people, purpose and profits.
Health and safety
The vast majority (87%) of organisations say health and safety risks to employees pose the biggest threat to their business. Due to the ongoing risk of communicable diseases, including pandemics, and need to mitigate rising cases of heart disease, cancer and mental health issues. As well as workforce exhaustion, with increasing workloads, constant change and poor work-life balance increasing risk of burnout.
Implication: Invest in benefits that manage health risks to boost human resilience and business resilience.
Governance and financial
The management of compensation, employee benefits and retirement plans is seen as the second biggest threat to business. People risk factors include administering plans fairly and prudently and the increasing cost of health, risk protection and wellbeing benefits. As well as the risk of misaligning benefit and other HR programmes with regulatory requirements, tax, labour and human rights and employment law.
Implication: Oversee all types of rewards to avoid costly errors and reputational damage. 
Accelerated digitisation
Accelerated digitisation gives rise to some of the people related risks in organisation businesses are most concerned about. These range from cyber security and data privacy to the impact of automation and AI on employees. Which is set to see 85m jobs become obsolete by 2025. Giving rise to skills obsolescence and misalignment of HR and business strategy if workforce planning and reskilling doesn’t keep pace.
Implication: Consider the impact of digitisation on employees to prevent future problems.
Talent practices
Human resource risk management linked to talent practices includes strengthening employee value proposition to attract and retain employees. As well as risks and inequalities linked to the changing nature of work. Ranging from people working more virtually and across different time zones to zero-hour contracts. Succession planning, conduct and culture and talent mobility are also people risk factors for this pillar.
Focus out what employees most value to increase your ability to secure future talent.
Environment and social
Organisations are feeling pressure from customers, investors, employees and regulators to ensure profit does not come at the expense of society or the planet. Related people risk factors include progressing environmental targets, improving working conditions and driving diversity, equality and inclusion. Supporting employees with catastrophic personal life events is now also seen as important to managing people risk.
Apply an ESG lens to investments, working conditions and employee benefits.

People risk management barriers
Our people risk research also explored the barriers to addressing people related risks in an organisation, across each of the five pillars. The main obstacles were as follows:
Difficulty changing personal behaviour
Organisational complexity
Lack of skilled resources to address risk
Download the full report
People risk management for employee benefits
Administering employee benefits, pensions and compensation is the second biggest individual people risk, after cyber security and data protection. Which is also linked to employee benefits due to the huge amount of personal data involved in administering employee benefits.
Without careful governance, and a deliberate strategy, employee benefits plans are unlikely to succeed at supporting business resilience. Even so three fifths of businesses (59%) don’t have effective governance for insurance and benefits. While just two in five (42%) have a benefit cost containment strategy in place. Falling to less than one in three (31%) employers in the United Kingdom.
Instead, with employee health benefits increasing at two and a half times the rate of inflation, cleaver employee benefits design is essential. This should not only look at optimising spend by reducing health risks, but also securing the best deals from insurers.
A clear governance approach for benefit and insurance programme design, delivery and financial decisions will also reduce costs and risk. Think about establishing a formal governance process, including defining roles and responsibilities for making benefits design, administration, communication, HR technology and insurance decisions.
People risk management ideas to get you started
Identify risks to boost business resilience
Review workplace and job risk and industry risk factors to understand where the greatest people risks are. Look at your employee data analytics to identify risks, or blind spots, and review benefit eligibility to see if any groups are being excluded or put at risk. 
Create multi-year people risk management strategies
Instead of just reacting or responding to immediate threats, look ahead to future risks. Be this AI, future of work or environmental risks. Create clear multi-year strategies and hire people for skills, and not just jobs, to secure the skills needed to address future risks.
Take a preventative approach to people risk management
Instead of paying to resolve problems when they arise, mitigate risk and cost with preventative strategies. Look at the underlying causes of people risks, such as cyber risks, loss of talent and absence, and take steps to mitigate these.

Flexible working | Workforce strategy
Gearing up for the future of flexible work 
Flexible working models are here to stay. It is time to make them work for your workforce.
All jobs can flex. This means that organisations can adopt a broader view of flexible working and offer a flex-working strategy that benefits everyone, not just those who work remotely. Despite the opportunities present in this area, our recent Global Talent Trends research revealed a disparity in opinions. Executives are concerned about remote working, but employees see things differently:
72%
of executives say they are concerned about the impact of remote work on the organisational culture. 
54%
of employees say they enjoy working remotely 100% of the time.
72%
of executives are concerned that remote workers will have a difficult time getting ahead or being promoted.
74%
of employees believe their organisations will be more successful with remote/hybrid workers.
HR will be a key mediator in bridging the gap between these differing perspectives.
Struggling with scale and impact
Most organisations are now working to build sustainable flexible working models. However, many are struggling to achieve scale and impact. In our research, 18% of leaders report that they are struggling to gain momentum and get buy-in for the adoption of new work designs, including flexible work.
Attracting and retaining talent
Many organisations are seeking to become more human. They are doing this by listening intently to their stakeholders, by using data to uncover behavioural patterns and guide action, and by speaking out on issues that matter. In many cases, this is also motivating them to adopt a more flexible approach to work. Overall, it is making them more open and relatable. Employees who are in a position to choose where they want to work will be attracted to such organisations. Creating a more human, and a more flexible work environment, is therefore becoming imperative for companies that want to attract and retain great talent.
Flexibility is a priority for employees
We asked employees, “As you think about flexibility in the future, once the pandemic has passed, how important is it to you?”
56%
“I would consider switching employers if it was not an option for me.”
38%
""It would improve my job satisfaction, but I would not seek a different employer.”
6%
""This is not a priority for me.”
Getting started
Evaluate how best to deliver flexible working options for all. Move beyond location-based flexibility to expand general access to flexible work arrangements. Consider how time-based flexibility, part-time work or contract-based work can be used as differentiators for your organisation — positives that will attract talent to join and remain with you.

Global Talent Trends : Rise of the relatable organisation
A moment of profound opportunity has arrived. Companies can now pick up the tools of empathy learnt and honed during the pandemic period and use them to carve out a new way of partnering that is more relatable, sustainable and attuned to the new shape of work. Flexible work models are the way of the future.

In an uncertain economy with forecasted long-term labor shortages, maximizing the value of your workforce and attracting new talent to your organization is critical. As the world of work continues to change rapidly, more than ever, the ability to transform with it is crucial to success.  That’s why embracing skills-based practices has become a top priority for companies — because reskilling is essential to transforming organizations for the future of work. Measuring skills and capabilities objectively bolsters talent acquisition, development, succession and your broader talent strategy. Unlock exponential results today through a focus on skills. 
Whether you’re looking to build a strong skills foundation, redesign the way you work or rethink how you attract, retain and develop talent, we can help. Implementing skills-based practices at scale requires collaboration across teams — you’ll need expertise that spans workforce transformation, data and tech products, and digital enablement. That’s where Mercer comes in. 
   Measuring skills in the age of agile work 
A skills-powered approach to talent management is essential for organizations aiming to thrive in the rapidly evolving work landscape. But mapping skills to work is only half the equation. To drive human-centric productivity, mapping skills to people is just as critical.

Nordic Talent Trends 2023
Mer än 70 organisationer och deras HR-ledare i Sverige, Danmark, Norge och Finland har delat med sig om vad som är top of mind i dessa utmanande tider.
European Union (EU) Equal Pay and Pay Transparency Directive
Under våren 2023 träder EU:s nya lönetransparensdirektiv i kraft. Data från över 30 branscher och 150 000 löntagare visar att svenska företag har löneskillnader som inte kommer att leva upp till EU:s krav. Mercer har kartlagt löneskillnader mellan könen i över 30 branscher och hos över 150 000 svenska löntagare. Kartläggningen visar att det är ett  substantiellt lönegap mellan män och kvinnor i nästan alla branscher.
Global Risk Report 2023
Global Risks Report 2023 som är publicerad av World Economic Forum i samarbete med Marsh McLennan, undersöker hur ökade  geopolitiska, ekonomiska och samhälleliga sprickor kommer att utlösa och förvärra kommande kriser.

Navigating the increasing complexities of talent mobility
Talent mobility considerations and costs are escalating. Organisations need mobility that delivers business value while containing costs. To add to the complexity, many employees are now expecting flexibility and remote working. What does this all mean for talent mobility, expatriate management and international assignments in general? Leverage Mercer’s expertise, data and technology to help you navigate that complexity.

41% of C-suite executives believe the fundamental shift in business requires a reset on work, the workforce, and the workplace, and 29% of executives want to grasp this opportunity to reimagine their international rotations.
The growing complexity of talent mobility
The pandemic has accelerated changes in global talent mobility trends and practices. In volatile times, companies are having to rethink their talent mobility strategies. 
One of the major considerations is balancing cost with the need for career development and organisational-needs-driven employee mobility. According to Mercer’s 2020 Worldwide International Assignment Policies and Practices survey, high costs remain among the main obstacles to talent relocation. 
Companies are looking for opportunities to replace traditional long-term assignments with alternative, less costly forms of talent mobility, including: 
Long-term assignments
Short-term assignments
One-way transfers
Internationally/ locally hired foreigner...
Localised or local plus
Domestic relocation
Business travel
Virtual assignments
At the same time, remote and hybrid working — initially forced by pandemic lockdown measures — are increasingly the lifestyle choices for many employees. They now expect to be able to work from anywhere, not just in the country, but in the world. The new expectations mean that mobility teams now need to manage globally distributed workforces, not just relocation processes. 
Understanding the cost of living in different locations is crucial for companies setting up compensation packages, and for employees concerned about their purchasing power abroad. 
Talent mobility is a complex subject that is driven by: 
Short- and long-term business goals and needs
Internal policies, technology and processes
International workforce upskilling and reskilling efforts, and
Career management considerations.
Mercer have the expertise, data, and technology solutions to manage that complexity. 
Talent mobility supports the business and the individual 
Strategic talent mobility should benefit the organisation and the individual. 
For the business:
Rightsizing and diversifying the international talent pool: Efficient mobility talent management goes hand in hand with decisions about international workforce resizing, reshaping and reskilling. It is as much about managing an international talent pool as about moving people from country to country
Fostering talent diversity: If gaining international experience is the best way to reach the most senior management positions, the underrepresentation of women and minorities in the expatriate workforce is undermining attempts to improve diversity
Ensuring the right leadership talent pipeline is in place
Addressing key skill shortages in critical markets
Protecting key talent, by deploying them tactically from stagnant markets to more active ones
And more generally, enabling the continued globalisation of functions and business activities
For the individual:
The right job: Not all positions are equal when it comes to boosting employees’ careers. The types of positions that are real career accelerators depend on the company and industry sector. Global mobility plays a role by allowing high-potential employees to access these jobs globally
The right skills: What skills does the employee need to accelerate their career? Is an international assignment (physical or virtual) the best way to acquire those skills? 
The right network: Proximity to top management, the opportunity to exchange and learn from the company’s experts, and more generally, the ability to network with those who can be qualified as the 'influencers' within the company is a differentiator. The location of employees (at HQ, in a major regional hub or on the contrary in a small, remote operation) impacts their ability to build an efficient network

Regional integration and the search for expatriate candidates globally.

Mobility strategy and talent management  
The greatest challenges in global mobility are in talent management. Mercer can help you bring together mobility and talent management.
Mobility policy design and update
Behind every successful global mobility programme is a well-thought-out policy that addresses business objectives, assignee expectations and market opportunities. The best policies read like a roadmap, connecting objectives with actions and actions with outcomes. They integrate best practices into an organisation’s overall culture to keep programmes competitive and market responsive, linking mobility with talent management and reward strategies.
Market benchmark your mobility policy
Can you prove that your strategy for rewarding and managing expatriates is working? Are your policies fair compared to what your competitors are doing? Can you document what you need to get support from other decision makers?
Mobility policy programme implementation and communication 
Whether creating entirely new programmes or building on existing ones, identifying potential challenges and impacts of the changes on the existing expatriate population is critical to achieving a smooth transition. 
Three critical areas — alignment, decision making and implementation — need to be considered.
Mobility programme process review
Given the tremendous cost of expatriates, companies that do not proactively review the effectiveness of their international assignment programmes – on a regular basis – run the risk of poorly executed policies, disenchanted and unproductive expatriates, and negative impact on the bottom line.
Advice for companies new to mobility
Deciding on the types of mobility policies to implement, as well as how to communicate and administer them has become a major challenge for companies going global. The first expat packages and terms are typically negotiated individually at HQ, but when programmes gain in scope and size, the need for a more structured approach often emerges in response to varying locations and task requirements.
Fostering diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) 
Moving talent between jobs and between geographies plays a key role in fostering diversity, equity and inclusion, and HR teams should be at the forefront of developing a diverse workforce.

Why digitisation is growing in importance
Rapid digital transformation is a priority for organisations all over the world. Firms must not only make changes to their business delivery, but also create a truly digital work experience for their employees.
This has been accelerated by COVID-19 and the workforce transformation it set in action. Employee expectations are changing. Two-in-five workers say they are less likely to leave the company if their employer promotes or sponsors digital health solutions. As such, HR teams must design employee experiences that are fit for a flexible, digital working environment.
Fortunately, accelerated digitisation has led to an explosion in digital health and well-being programmes, which have become more relevant and have gained significant traction.
However, people management practices have not kept pace with other technological developments. Risks involving cybersecurity, loss of personal information, and system obsolescence are heightened due to how HR data is maintained, and how benefits and other HR programmes are delivered.
HR and benefits teams will need to find ways to unite employees in a shared employee experience, wherever and however they are working.

Mercer Marsh Benefits Digital Growth Leader
Providing a consistent digital experience
Consistency rises up the agenda
The role of digitisation
Boosting HR technology
Getting started on your digitalisation journey
Five questions those responsible for HR and risk must ask to ensure that policies and practices are relevant and effective:
Are we confident the risk of a breach associated with HR data is sufficiently mitigated?
Are employees’ personal details such as salary or dependent information being shared with third parties using spreadsheets? Is that a risk you are comfortable with?
Are our HR processes aligned to the employee experience we are seeking to create?
81% of employers said that achieving a ‘globally consistent employee experience’ is a ‘high priority’, and its importance has increased year-on-year since 2018.
Have we modernised our health programmes in light of a rapidly changing digital health ecosystem?
Prior to the pandemic, 68% of employers said they were likely to invest in digital health in the next five years. Interest was strongest among employers in high-tech, manufacturing/construction, and financial services/insurance.
What is our digitisation strategy?
Make sure you know who is driving digitisation in your organisation, and what contribution is needed from HR and the enterprise risk management team in order to craft a cohesive digital agenda.
Is our employee experience for managing benefits “consumer-grade”?
Sadly, for many employees, enrolling and accessing benefits is still a frustrating experience. Over the coming years, the bar will continue to be raised. At a minimum, even if programmes are highly fragmented, employers must determine what their digital approach to health, risk protection, and wellbeing programmes is and then work to continuously improve by delivering a more simple, fun, and integrated experience over time.

Alerta de Fraude
Alguns sites e plataformas estão usando indevidamente o nome da Mercer Brasil, CNPJ e suas imagens para divulgar ofertas de emprego e oportunidades divulgando dinheiro de maneira rápida e fácil, através de sites/plataformas com vendas de mercadorias.
Existem vários tipos de abordagens indevidas, que podem ser realizadas por meio de sites ou plataformas falsas, mensagens no WhatsApp, redes sociais ou e-mails que se fazem passar pela Mercer Brasil.
A Mercer não envia mensagens pedindo informações pessoais, dinheiro ou oferece pagamentos para as pessoas, por isso, não informe dados pessoais. Além disso, não pede pagamentos, nem investimentos de nenhum tipo para candidatos participarem de seleção para empregos.

The future of work is transforming at light speed
The COVID-19 pandemic has proved that unexpected events can upend the world rapidly. During these fast-evolving times, successful organisations will embrace transformation, explore innovative ways of working and reinvent their employee experiences to suit the new, blended work environment.
Challenges and barriers organisations may encounter on their transformation journey include:
Business strategy misaligned to workforce and organisation strategy
Business not equipped for the new shape of work
A culture that is overly based on command and control 
Digitalisation not realising its full potential
Low effectiveness and efficiency of the HR function
Transforming for the future
Mercer helps organisations align transformation efforts with their culture, purpose and values – delivering sustainable progress toward strategic goals including growth, innovation and sustainability. By working with us to develop new workforce capabilities and increase agility, companies can drive performance and improve business results.
A transformation journey presents an opportunity to align leadership, and to inspire and connect stakeholders. Effective change management ensures that everyone is equipped for the change and aligned to a shared future vision.
In a world of business model disruption, inorganic growth strategies are increasingly critical to success. With investor pressure coming from all sides, this dynamic environment for M&A deals is gaining heightened attention. Mercer’s M&A advisory services can solve even the toughest people challenges – helping organisations maximise value, mitigate risk and moderate costs to capture the total value of the deal.

Standout talent mobility plans attract the workforce of the future 
Create a global mobility programme to attract and retain top mobile talent 
With top talent in high demand, organisations are elevating the mobile employees experience to attract the international workforce they need to succeed. Organisations that can provide the right degree of flexibility to their employees and that offer appealing, sustainable global mobility programmes gain a competitive advantage.  
To optimise global talent mobility programmes, international HR teams are increasingly adopting cutting-edge technology that makes the entire mobility management process simple and seamless for mobility teams, managers and international assignees. Companies need to manage costs while still offering competitive compensation packages. Researching the cost of living and pay differences around the world while checking local talent pools to find new talent is part of this balancing act.
The organisation’s cost considerations must be balanced with employees’ standard of living. Livability varies and is driven by factors such as housing, medical care, infrastructure, culture and recreation, education, availability of goods and services, climate, sanitation, geographical remoteness, and the prevalence of disease and violence. Companies are trying to objectively assess these differentials to ensure equity for all mobile employees, no matter where they are working. Employees moving to a city with a lower quality of living receive quality of living allowances.
Finding the right balance between conflicting priorities, and the right mix of technology, flexibility and consistent policies, determine companies’ capacity to attract and retain top mobile talent.

Digital strategy | Organisation design
Create a digital strategy to harmonize your technology 
How many disparate systems and manual processes are you managing?
Do you need a digital strategy?
Companies with digital ambitions and maturity derive greater benefit from their digital transformation, drive 16% more revenue and are 9% to 26% more profitable than their industry competitors. Is it time you invested in a digital strategy?
We recommend that organizations take a holistic approach across the spectrum of HR strategy, HR processes, technology and users in the business. This is particularly true for mergers, acquisitions and disposals, where there is a need to harmonize these systems.
A lack of standardization results in reporting and analytical issues.
Assess your current state
Let’s assess your current state of play to determine whether you need a digital strategy:
What’s the prevalence of in-house, bespoke systems requiring significant maintenance and support?
How many disparate systems and manual processes are you managing? For instance, is there no single HR/finance/benefits system of record?
How are you leveraging emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, algorithms and robotic process automation?
What is your current technology landscape and operations model?
How is your current technology helping or hindering your ability to enact policies and processes?

Getting started
Mercer has the expertise to help you harmonize your HR technology. We start by reviewing current and often fragmented systems to collaborate with clients in developing coordinated, streamlined processes to improve performance, governance, digitalization and employee experience.
We build client solutions by carefully vetting the right partners for digital strategies, cloud readiness and vendor selection services.
Sharing the lessons of experience
Mercer helped Santander prepare to transform its HR processes, organization and technology. After analyzing the situation through stakeholder interviews, we developed an ideal process landscape and governance definition and determined future IT support needs. We then created a roadmap and elaboration to implement a new HR interaction model.

Employee well-being 
Business success directly correlates to the health and well-being of the people who work there.
Improving employee well-being through benefits
Employee well-being is a top priority on the corporate agenda as companies and their boards connect and correlate it with success.
All too often, socioeconomic factors determine whether an employee is entitled to benefits, insurance and health coverage. This means that disadvantaged groups often miss out — despite needing the most help. In light of this, employers must urgently address outdated and inadequate healthcare benefits and implement plans designed to support all of their workers.
The global COVID-19 pandemic has given HR and benefits professionals the opportunity to reinvent health and well-being plans – turning caring into a competitive advantage.
By creating a robust strategy, HR professionals can promote better employee health while also improving business outcomes such as productivity, engagement, retention and trust.
This can be done by focusing on the four pillars of employee well-being:
Mental
Physical
Social
Financial
Mental: Mitigating the employee mental health crisis
Good workplace mental health has always been a critical part of overall well-being, but businesses are now becoming more aware of the role they can play in helping employees achieve it. Tackling mental health issues in the workplace has also taken on greater urgency as more people than ever suffer from conditions such as stress- and trauma-related disorders, anxiety and depression.
The good news is that opportunities to fill the gaps in medical plans and provide mental healthcare to the workforce are plentiful. Employers can do the right thing and meet growing societal obligations while also protecting the health of their businesses.
This can also provide the business with a competitive advantage. Our Health on Demand research shows that workers increasingly turn to their employers as trusted providers of health support. Indeed, mental health provision is a core differentiator, which can boost talent acquisition and retention. (This research shows that 42% of employees with access to mental health benefits are less likely to leave the company compared to 27% of those without access).
Equally, people whose employers provide a wide range of health and well-being benefits are more loyal, more engaged and less likely to leave a company.
Three steps to take now
Understand the mental health needs of your workforce
An annual health risk assessment should include a mental health section that explores levels of anxiety, depression and burnout as well as self-care habits.
Monitor the landscape for new, high-quality mental health solutions
Address the full range of services, from prevention to treatment regimens. Look at ways to fund access to basic needs, such as including therapy under medical insurance. 
Develop a mental health strategy for your workforce
This should not only look at supporting those who are out sick, but also enhance overall well-being and include mental health education.
Physical: Addressing the gap in healthcare affordability
Traditionally, employers have provided more comprehensive benefits for higher earners and management. However, this approach alienates lower-earning employees and discriminates against certain groups. This can lead to unfulfilled care expectations and cause staff to become disillusioned and demotivated. The traditional approach can also produce high turnover among under-served groups and even damage the reputation for employers who are seen to fail in this area.
To respond to this challenge, businesses must “flip the pyramid” on how they approach the provision of healthcare benefits. To do this, firms should provide equitable levels of support for employees at every level of their organisation, focusing on previously unmet needs.
The process must start with addressing affordability. At Mercer Marsh Benefits we are seeing many firms devising strategies to tackle cost issues. These strategies include providing affordable insurance for entry-level and junior employees.
Access to healthcare is equally critical. Fortunately, a paradigm shift in employer behaviour can be seen, with many firms now focused on ensuring that quality healthcare and infrastructure are available to all employees regardless of job, role or function.
Four steps to take now
Review your benefit programmes
Eliminate outdated, inappropriate and inadequate plans.
Have conversations about environmental, social and governance 
As part of your ongoing vendor management activities, these discussions with insurers should inform you about what they are doing in this field.
Determine to what extent your benefits should align to your DEI goals
Refine your benefit strategy accordingly.
Continue to advocate for better collection and sharing of data
Allow for anonymised and aggregated identification of workforce health trends. This data should include coding for social factors that influence health and well-being.

Using analytics to create a culture of health and well-being
Providing early and frequent well-being support is not only the right thing to do, it also leads to a more engaged workforce. Our global Health on Demand 2021 research shows that employees who feel well supported and have access to wide range of benefits are more productive, better engaged, and less likely to leave their jobs.
Using analytics, HR leaders can go far beyond tracking the success of one benefit or the preferences of one region. They can create and track benefits personas, enabling them to gain a richer understanding of benefits use across their organisation and target communications. This is particularly useful in global organisations, where one, unified system can be used to understand how needs differ across, or transcend, geographies and departments. 
HR teams equipped with analytics capabilities are able to see in near real-time how the fallout from the pandemic impacted their benefits offering and could identify any gaps or successes that appeared. By tracking reimbursements, for example, employers could see people swapping out gym memberships for virtual classes and deduce that employees were finding other ways to remain fit and healthy while working from home. 
This understanding might lead them to further supplement their wellbeing programs, with virtual nutrition workshops or cooking classes, for example. Analytics can then help monitor scheme take-up, helping HR leaders assess whether new benefits deliver a good return on investment. 
Learnings from the Mercer Marsh Benefits webinar
Forward-looking and innovative firms continue to evolve and foster new ideas on how to create a culture of health that promotes the well-being of all employees. Speaking at a Mercer Marsh Benefits webinar, Bernie Knobbe, SVP, Global Benefits & Well-being, Human Resources at AECOM shared some of the creative initiatives the firm has launched to create what he calls a “culture of caring”.
Key initiatives included:
“Well-binars”: The firm held webinars on well-being for all employees globally.

Safeguard week: The firm’s safety week was rebranded as Safeguard Week to better reflect its core values. It included animated videos and a virtual exhibition hall to engage employees and promote the well-being programme.

#WellbeingMoments: This initiative encouraged people to think of well-being moments each day and share them with colleagues. Team leaders share their personal well-being moments at the beginning of employee meetings and leadership Town Halls.

Let’s Talk Campaign: This started as a one-month campaign to promote emotional, social and intellectual well-being but has been ongoing ever since. Managers are encouraged to ask employees questions such as: “How are you doing?” and “Is there anything I can do to support you?” The campaign emphasises one-to-one meetings and making sure people are comfortable discussing these issues.

Better use of the EAP: AECOM created a template message to ensure that at the end of employee communications there was a reminder that the global EAP was there to support people 24/7 worldwide. This also included links to the global well-being site and the AECOM benefits sites.

Super Six Challenge: For six months, AECOM is running a competition where once a month, a person is selected based on the number of likes that they received about their own well-being story. In addition to receiving various rewards, the winner’s photo is made into a superhero animated character and featured on internal websites.

Repositioning Well-being Ambassadors: AECOM has well-being ambassadors in local offices, but with people working remotely, they weren’t as effective. The company expanded the ambassador toolkit to include more resources that could be offered virtually, to meet employees where they are, in office or remote.

“Nominate your manager” programme: This programme allows employees to nominate managers for well-being certificates once a month for promoting a culture of well-being among their teams

Employee benefits optimisation to attract and retain talent 
Keep your benefits fit for the future
With employers facing global skills shortages, it has never been more important to think about optimising your employee benefits. Properly optimised benefits not only reduce people risks and boost health and engagement but can also help companies attract and retain talent.
Critical to success is collecting and interpreting data on which benefits your employees are actually using. This can then be used to inform strategies on how best to strengthen your employee value proposition (EVP). For example, introducing new mental health benefits in response to increasing health insurance costs linked to fatigue or burnout.
Despite the value of such a data-driven approach, analysing the data required remains a challenge for HR. 80% of employee benefits data analysis is still done using spreadsheets at a time when other functions, including finance and marketing, are already using automated analytics.
Technology for employee benefits optimisation
When HR teams have to manually gather, standardise and analyse employee benefits data, time is wasted, and the insights quickly become dated. Thankfully, technology is now transforming how companies manage employee benefits, with two-thirds (67%) of employers saying they plan to centralise HR. Many hope to utilise technology to drive efficiencies and create a more unifying and equitable global employee benefits experience.
Technology is also driving total rewards optimisation by allowing employees to use their benefits from any location at any time. The value of this flexibility was realised during the pandemic, with employers quickly pivoting their benefits offerings. It has now become a must for any highly distributed workforce.
In addition to harmonising employee benefits, centralised benefits technology provides data insights to create a consistent employee experience. Analysing the data allows you to see how employees are using benefits in real time to determine which benefits are proving effective. These insights can then inform your employee benefits optimisation strategy to improve engagement and reduce costs.
Putting benefits insights to work
Once you know how and why people are using their benefits, you can use these insights to streamline your offering. If employees respond to a recession by decreasing voluntary pension contributions, what financial well-being benefits should you introduce?
Lessons can again be learnt from the pandemic. Employers used real-time insights to identify any gaps or successes that appeared in their benefits offerings. By tracking reimbursements, many employers saw people swapping out gym memberships for virtual classes and commuter passes for bikes. This understanding led to the introduction of further digital healthcare solutions. The analysis on take-up of these new benefits was then used to further optimise total rewards offerings.
By analysing total rewards, HR leaders can go beyond tracking the success of a single benefit or one region’s preferences. They can create and track personas to generate a data-driven picture of how benefits are used to share with the C-suite. This, in turn, will drive optimisation, potentially making the difference between retaining or losing benefits budget.
Principles of employee benefits optimisation
There are three key principles to effective benefits optimisation.
Use data-driven insights
Employee benefits optimisation requires quickly generating analytics on how benefits are being utilised as well as by whom and when. These insights can then be used to inform and drive strategy.
Measure the return on employee benefits to justify budget
Use your data insights to benchmark your employee engagement against peer organisations and determine competitiveness. Also measure the ROI on existing and new benefits to justify your budget to the board.
Use technology to personalise the employee experience
Centralise benefits and use technology to generate data insights. These insights can also be used to personalise the employee experience, tailoring communications to optimise engagement and loyalty.

2025 Theme: Swing state
The theme for this year’s Global Investment Forum, ""Swing State,"" reflects an investment environment defined by shifting dynamics. The past four years have been marked by powerful shifts—from the COVID-19 pandemic to escalating conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East—that continue to reshape the global landscape and challenge conventional portfolio thinking.
Inflationary pressures appear to be subsiding, setting interest rates on a downward swing, while market concentration has reached historic highs, heightening systemic risk from a handful of dominant companies. At the same time, government debt in developed economies remains strained, and emissions continue to rise despite technological advances.
As we assess where we are in this pendulum swing, understanding the potential impacts on portfolios will be critical. Each swing presents risks and opportunities, calling for a balanced approach and an expanded perspective to navigate an unpredictable path forward.

Employee benefits strategy 
02 October 2022
Employee benefits are more crucial than ever, so it’s critical you have the right strategy in place to implement and manage them.
Employee benefits empower businesses to attract and retain the very best talent while supporting staff throughout the moments that matter most. As a result of the changing workplace in last few years, businesses have been forced to reevaluate their employee benefits offerings to ensure they are fit for purpose. Business leaders recognise the importance of benefits and technology in improving employee wellbeing, engagement and loyalty, with 56% of employees agreeing that the benefits their employer provides make them feel valued.
There are numerous things to consider when developing a successful employee benefits strategy. For example:
A  variety of personalised benefits is needed to meet individual needs
Diversity, equity and inclusion must be considered 
Technology is critical to delivering employee benefits effectively on a global and local scale
Analytics are key for reshaping rewards and benefits
Here we look at ways to build the best employee benefits strategy for your business.
Using analytics to reshape rewards and benefits
Considering  the equivalent of 20% base salary on average is channelled into employee benefits, it’s surprising that this investment still receives little scrutiny. While many functions, such as finance or marketing, have employed analytics for some time, 80% of employers still rely solely on spreadsheets to analyse employee benefits data.
Attempting to effectively gather, standardise and analyse data on thousands of global employees without the effective analytics is impossible. It also makes it more likely that decisions will be made using out-of-date data, or that a single point of failure, will bring the whole system crashing down. Furthermore, it’s difficult to ensure manual systems remain GDPR compliant, leaving organisations open to errors that could lead to huge financial and reputational risk.  
Analytics should underpin every element of your HR and benefits strategy. It is invaluable in tracking changes to employee benefits behaviour for example, enabling organisations to stay agile and keep their offering relevant. For example, as the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic took hold, organisations with this capability were able to track changes.
Within this new context, employers already equipped with analytics capabilities reaped rewards. These HR teams were able to see in near real-time how the fallout from the pandemic impacted their benefits offering and could identify any gaps or successes that appeared. 
This understanding can lead to strategy changes: such as supplementing their wellbeing programmes, with virtual nutrition workshops or cooking classes, for example. Analytics help monitor scheme take-up, enabling HR teams to assess whether their benefits are being used by their workforce and delivering a good return on investment. 
Developing benefits for the remote working era
Beyond managing the immediate people issues presented by the remote working era, teams must make sure they keep a long-term view and do all they can to their keep their best people on board. This hinges on creating an engaging and personalised employee experience, one where development, wellbeing and relevance take priority. 
Four priorities for HR teams in the remote working era
Be clear on your commitment to well-being
Clearly communicating how employees can access support when working remotely and explaining what’s on offer will help them to feel more appreciated and secure within their organisation.
Kick-start skills
Providing virtual training sessions and online courses can help to continue — and even advance — employee development, preparing your organisation and employees for the future of work.
Optimise remote working
Give people the tools and training they need to do their jobs from anywhere and provide benefits that help to optimise this new employee experience. This will help them stay connected to their organisations.
Make the most of data
Employers will need a steady stream of data on how employees are using their benefits to make sure their offering stays relevant.

Using technology to deliver employee benefits on a global scale
Providing a ‘globally consistent employee experience’ has been the number one priority for multinational organisations for the last few years and has now been propelled even higher up the corporate agenda.
The big win from investing in HR technology is that employers have been able to pivot their benefits offering to deal with the unprecedented challenge of keeping employees connected, engaged and supported across the world.
Technology is integral in keeping employees engaged with their benefits, allowing them to view and use them from any location and at any time, delivering real value. This level of flexibility was important pre-pandemic, but it’s become a must-have in today’s highly distributed work environment.
How to create a consistent benefits experience across different markets
Appreciate  and identify local nuances. 
To get benefits right in any given country, teams have to understand local nuances, local legislation and maintain competitive vendor relationships – amongst a raft of other, complex issues. Without this understanding, there can be a barrier to consistency.
Centralise HR systems.
This empowers organisations to quickly and securely share, access and analyse employee data across countries, giving them a more accurate overview of their entire global offering.
Use analytics to identify commonalities. 
Using centralised tools allows HR teams to use the same metrics across locations, identify and share best practice, and update their strategy in response to how well each country or region is performing.
Now more than ever, it’s paramount that employers balance keeping a handle on costs, while ensuring all employees feel a sense of connection and support, which will fundamentally keep them happy and engaged.

Talent strategy challenges
Attracting, developing and retaining talent for the most critical roles in the company
Growing competition and changing talent expectations
Combining business and people priorities, with the talent experience at the centre
Assessing and understanding the people and skills we have now and preparing for what we will need in the future
Upskilling and reskilling the workforce to address significant business challenges
Rethinking how to prioritise talent related to automation, AI and other digital forces
Understanding what different employee populations expect from us
Craft a future-focused talent strategy
Today’s organisations face unprecedented pressure to reskill and redeploy talent to stay competitive. A more diverse demographic profile, digital ways of working and shifting expectations are reshaping the future of work. These forces demand a rethink of how organisations prepare to attract, develop and retain talent for the most critical roles needed now and in the future. The right talent creates innovative cultures within a company and thus can attract more of the best talent.
An effective talent management strategy helps to:
Transform the organisation and work design into a simpler, more agile structure, moving away from a traditional multilayered organisation
Identify the levers needed to address and solve people-centred challenges
Align innovative technology and skills to transform the workplace
Balance the strategic business and workforce strategies with operational implementation
Future-proof your organisation by closing the readiness gap and addressing the people impact
85%
of companies are co-creating new employee experiences with their people.
77%
of employees trust their companies to invest in their learning and skill development.
Create an impactful talent strategy
With an ever-evolving operational environment posing new challenges in redefining work, flexible arrangements and emerging to a post-pandemic world, organisations — now, more than ever — need to reset their talent priorities with a refreshed strategy.
These five key questions are crucial to consider during a talent management strategy refresh:
What is the best framework for activating our organisation’s business strategy through the lens of human capital?
How is our organisation’s talent distributed across critical demographics, and what is the projection for the future?
What external talent forces need to be considered as we think about their impact on our workforce?
What is our view on how work will be redefined to deliver responsibilities within increasingly agile frameworks?
How do we ensure diversity, equity and inclusion are woven into our end-to-end value proposition?
Talent strategies prioritise future workforce needs
The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated conversations about the future of work, transforming decades of thinking on work automation and flexibility into action. This shift presents an opportunity to renew talent management strategies and prepare your business for future success.

Our talent strategy framework
Mercer is uniquely positioned to deliver value through talent segmentation and engagement by building synergy between people and technology. Let us help you reimagine how talent can be connected to work. Our talent strategy framework balances the business and people impacts with the talent experience.
Business impact
includes the internal and external factors that shape an organisation and its people and capability needs. Excellent talent management tangibly supports business objectives and strategies.
People impact
concerns user/target group needs and preferences. Excellent talent management delivers on employee expectations, which is also measurable through engagement and performance.
Talent experience
aggregates the experiences of everyone in an organisation. It concerns talent management touchpoints and processes within a talent framework that caters to the interests of both the business and the people.

Bringing the talent management framework to life
Bringing a talent management strategy to life requires a multidimensional implementation approach to address strategy and purpose, organisation and roles, services and processes, and culture and leadership. At the heart of the talent strategy, and involved at every step, is the talent experience.

Delivering the M&A deal 
Author

Global, US and Canada M&A Advisory Services Leader, Mercer
Tapping into the unrealised potential of people to deliver M&A deal value creation
The value of people in M&As
Investors and companies undertake deals to create value. Our research indicates that 47% of deals that fail do so primarily due to a lack of strategic planning and execution rigour related to people risks.
This report examines what that means to dealmakers worldwide, drawing from a wide variety of datasets and insights. The significant body of data reveals practical insights from an in-depth survey of deal professionals across the entire transactional spectrum.
3 priorities across the deal life cycle
Value creation is critical and complex. Weaving together insights from survey respondents and case studies, we found the following to be top priorities across deal phases:
Operational stability
Customer and client retention
Bespoke value creation
Strategies for acquisitive growth
Channel strategy optimisation
New product development
What are the priorities for people strategy in deals?
Based on the significance of post-close issues that hampered value creation, respondents cite their top areas of focus as:
Alignment of leadership
Alignment of organisational culture
Retention of key employees
What we learnt
There is a clear connection between the rigour with which people issues are proactively addressed and the likelihood of deal success. Aligning the deal thesis with how leadership acts, the organisational behaviours the culture reinforces, and the talent skill sets retained and attracted is key.
Key aspects of people strategy that derail deals
When left unaddressed, these key aspects can derail an M&A deal:
19.8%
Leadership team
16%
Organisational culture
9.3%
Lack of change management strategy

Most deals fail due to a lack of focus on people. But that mindset is changing as it’s people that can unlock deal value.

Wake up to the people issues
Don't neglect people risks and HR problems
Most M&A deals fail to deliver value because they don’t focus on the workforce issues. Know the red flags and call out people risks early.

Our HR transformation philosophy

The challenge is to reshape the model into a diamond by transforming from a transactional to a strategic focus through automation and radical simplification. 
HR Transformation philosophy
Text description
The HR function is being transformed
65%

Mercer’s HR transformation solutions
HR vision and strategy roadmap (HR Accelerator)
Create a map for your future HR vision and strategy that can transform your HR content, processes, organisation and technology.
HR target interaction model and HR operating model
Create an HR target interaction model (TIM) to meet the strategic objectives of the organisation and unlock the employee experience.
HR process design, automation and radical simplification
Creating exceptional moments that matter for all employees requires a careful look at employee programmes and processes, most of which were designed with in-person interactions in mind. 
HR technology strategy and advisory
We can implement a variety of solutions with in-house resources from our Digital Teams. We partner with an array of providers to select the best solutions for our clients’ individual needs. Our recommendations are impartial and not biased toward any specific vendors.
Talent acquisition
Mercer’s talent acquisition solutions help clients set up their employee value propositions, recruiting processes, organisation and technology to attract and retain employees who are critical to their future success.
Future HR skills
Mercer Learning collaborates with leading content providers, offering the best scalable (digital) learning solutions customised to your HR upskilling requirements.
What’s different about Mercer’s approach?
Mercer uses a targeted interaction model (TIM) to help HR teams identify their particular workforce needs (interactions) from various parts of the organisation. We then set up cross-functional service teams to handle these interactions. The employee-centric model helps to:
Explore employee journeys and models.
Co-design a new approach within the business.
Implement new design, with technology tools available.
Prototype, test and iterate.
How can you harness collective energy in a tired world?
Design human-centric work experiences.
Build a relatable people function.
Optimise the combination of touch and technology with co-creation.
Build human capabilities that match the pace of digital transformation.
Use a TIM to redesign your people function.

Attracting and retaining talent in 'the great talent gap' 
Author
Lewis Garrad
Partner, Asia Career Practice Leader
Meeting the challenge of breaching “the great talent gap” requires new solutions for attracting and retaining talent in an employee-centric market.
An overwhelming 96% of executives say we are in an employee-centric labour market and 70% of HR professionals are predicting higher than normal turnover this year.
Mercer's Global Talent Trends 2022 Study
We’re currently experiencing a great talent gap. The gap — between having the talent to operate optimally and the actual talent available — is what employers are trying to breach. 
According to the U.S. Bureau of Labour Statistics, on the last business day of March 2022, the number of job openings in the country was 11.5 million. To put that number in perspective, Belgium – the 24th most wealthy country in the world by GDP – has a total population of about 11.5 million.1 The gap translates into a lot of missing talent and lost economic activity. 
In the same month, there were only 6.7 million hires, and resignations edged up to 4.5 million, and those numbers were in the U.S. alone.2 Across the world, workers are quitting in historical numbers, so much so, ‘The Great Resignation’ got its own Wiki entry on February 2022.  
This tightness in the labour market has been exacerbated by a vast array of complex issues that have accelerated in the past two and half years. Although it’s understandable that many people find changing jobs to be liberating during a period of limited freedom, the reduction in available talent is also driven by demographic and economic factors:
Many women (and some men) have found increased caregiving and unpaid responsibilities to be too stressful to mix with employment at this time. 
A 2020 Indian study found that domestic duties increased for all during pandemic lockdowns, but the burden was disproportionally borne by women.3
Many immigrant workers were not able to find new opportunities in other countries due to closed borders or challenging political environments; and many skilled expats are still opting to move home to be closer to family. 
For a stark example, in the month of February 2022, the cosmopolitan metropolis of Hong Kong experienced a net outflow of 71,000 people.5
Others may feel confident enough to be less economically active because of gains in the global stock market or with cryptocurrency during 2021.
There is also a shortage of people with sufficient skills to move into new roles created by emerging technologies or the development of digital industries.
Although many organisations are seeing elevated levels of turnover across job levels, and the challenge of attracting and retaining talent is nearly universal, the most significant number of resignations is happening with hourly, lower-skilled, frontline and entry-level employees. This is perhaps one of the clearest indications that fixed roles/jobs with the least flexibility are quickly becoming the least attractive. 
Retaining talent: Essential workers deserve meaningful work, even while trying to make ends meet 
One of the most interesting trends of the last couple of years is the emergence of the “essential worker.” This is a person whom society relies upon to show up in a physical place to get something done, no matter what.
These essential workers are in fixed roles, and they are often on the lower end of the compensation spectrum. To put a finer point on it, they must physically show up and deal with inflexible hours, and their work is often highly repetitive.
The nature of lower-skilled work is not new. But the current talent market is fundamentally different from the one in 2019. Every neighbourhood cafe is advertising for baristas, and that difference means lower-skilled employees can now choose where they work, how they work (to an extent) and what work they do.
In January 2022, a major hospitality employer in Australia advertised for dishwashers at the hitherto-unimaginable wage-for-role of AU $120,000 (approximately US $85,400) because that was the amount it took to attract interest. But more money only fixes part of the talent retention problem. When people are choosing to leave unsatisfactory roles, there are better and more permanent fixes.
A Tale of Two Baristas: Purpose as a talent retention
Which barista contributes more meaningfully to the café, has more purposeful days and therefore more likely to stay?
Barista A: Works 6 am to 2 pm, making coffee, tea, hot chocolate, and chai and helps out doing odd jobs in the kitchen when not busy.
Barista B: Works 6 am to 2 pm, making coffee, tea, hot chocolate, and chai. In between peak beverage times:
Researches fair trade suppliers, new trends and more sustainable takeaway containers
Takes stock and orders supplies
Talks to roasters about trying out new coffee blends
Trains others on how to make the different beverages.
Retaining talent: Professional employees also want meaning and purpose
As with lower-skilled employees, the flight from employers for professionals is actually a flight away from work without purpose and meaning. It’s also a move away from work that doesn’t match the post-pandemic lifestyle which many people are now striving to maintain.
One of the unintended consequences of digital working is that it has emphatically reminded individuals — day after day — of exactly what their jobs entail. Working in lockdown stripped away everything outside work  that might have influenced employees’ perceptions of their roles. What do they truly do in the absence of watercooler chats, lunches with colleagues and brainstorming meetings? And the inevitable questions that follow are: 
“Do I actually like my job?”
“Why do I do my job?”
Employers that successfully retain talent are the ones that can help their employees answer these questions well or, if not, find inspiring solutions.

Four more essentials in attracting and retaining talent
Understand your employee experience
It’s hard to retain talent if you don’t understand why they are unhappy and/or resigning. Exit interviews are too late. By designing a mechanism to really listen to the voice of your employees while they are with you, you will be much better placed to begin addressing the causes of attrition. 
Powerful insights can come from asking open-ended questions in online questionnaires and allowing employees to share their thoughts. Advanced qualitative methods like natural language processing should be used to develop rich descriptions of employee experiences.
Money is great (and not so great)
Money is important. It’s the basic extrinsic motivator when it comes to work. And there is no denying its criticality in talent attraction, so companies like Costco and the Bank of America are raising the minimum wage they are paying. 
But money’s powers are not superpowers. Almost every employer has the capacity to pay more. The catch is that you have to match your pay strategies with the labour market, and unfortunately, paying more doesn’t mean you get more.
To be sure you are paying the right employee compensation for the right talent, you need to begin with a robust employee reward strategy and comprehensive market data.
Manage employee stress and create an employee value proposition (EVP) that addresses unmet needs
From fertility treatments to scholarships, employers are building EVPs with enticing benefits to attract and retain talent. When building EVPs, however, it’s easy to feel the pressure to follow trends, but trends might not work for your particular employee population. It’s crucial that you begin by understanding your people’s needs.
Employees continue to face multiple unpredictable reverberations from the pandemic and other major world events, resulting in a range of new or aggravated sources of stress impacting their mental and physical health. Work should not be adding to that negative impact. 
The more companies understand people’s stress and critical unmet needs, the better they can judge the programmes, rewards or experiences that would differentiate their EVPs or better communicate what current programmes exist to help alleviate those stressors. 
Upskilling is a critical investment in talent retention
Personal development and employee training are at the epicentre of the new work deal. You can retain talent by building a compelling career with your organisation. 
Even before the pandemic, 78% of employees said they were ready to learn new skills. Ensuring people sustainability through future employability is now a critical part of the employment contract. Organisations can empower individual employees to upskill by building strategic training opportunities within a robust career framework, one that has clear and transparent pathways for employees to follow.

To maintain and inspire productivity, you have to tap into extrinsic and intrinsic motivators. 
Mercer can help you do both so you can retain your people and inspire them to be their best.

DEI insights | DEI
A strategic approach to diversity, equity and inclusion can help people and societies thrive 
Organisational health is increasingly dependent on embedding DEI measures throughout the business.
Accelerated by global calls for racial justice and equity, organisational focus on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) has evolved from a “nice to have” to a business imperative. Consumers, investors, communities and talent are now seeking out companies that are making progress on social sustainability measures — moving the needle on the “S” of ESG, which has DEI at its heart. 
When leaders proactively work to advance equality, they tend to see improvements in their bottom lines. The employee experience becomes more appealing — organisations are better equipped to attract and retain top talent, and people are more highly engaged and motivated to increase productivity and performance. And when the workforce includes people from diverse backgrounds who feel empowered to present ideas born of a variety of experiences, innovation grows.
That’s why more organisations are embedding DEI measures into their strategies and creating measurable business goals around them. This means integrating DEI considerations across: 
Engagement, accountability and leadership
Organisation design and governance
Pay equity commitments and analysis
Talent practices and career development
Financial wellness, health and caregiving
Organisational flexibility
Policies and programmes
As leading organisations strive to make an impact, they also have the power to extend change from the inside out, contributing to a more open and inclusive society.
Organisations are increasingly being evaluated on how well they perform against criteria beyond financial performance — measures that represent different dimensions of stakeholder capitalism.

Improve the well-being of your people and the resilience of your business
Employee health and well-being influences productivity, safety, business continuity, employer brand, organisational performance and benefit costs.

It is imperative for companies’ overall benefit strategies to include health and well-being as critical elements, while considering that diverse segments of the workforce will require tailored solutions.
How organisations can build effective employee health programmes
The health and well-being of your workforce is critical to the success of the business. What’s more, when employees have access to a wide range of benefits, they tend to be healthier, more productive, and more loyal.
Our Health on Demand 2023 report found that 72% of employees with access to 10 or more benefits are more likely to stay with their employer, and 88% feel their employer cares about their health and wellbeing, while 82% say they are thriving in their current role.
So how can you ensure your employee well-being programme meets the needs of your workforce?
It’s important to address the four main areas of wellness:
Physical health
Employers that proactively mitigate health issues through targeted interventions drive positive business outcomes.
Mental well-being
42% of employees say quality mental health support is difficult to find or access. Employers can help — and our research shows it will mean a lot to the workforce if they do.
Financial wellness
49% of employees would highly value access to financial wellness and financial planning tools.

Transform your employees’ health and benefits experience
The future of work depends on healthy, focused employees. As medical costs continue to rise, now is the time to consider bold new measures to deliver maximum value and balance healthcare cost concerns with empathy and employee engagement.
On the one hand, organisations must keep costs to a minimum and protect the bottom line, while also meeting changing regulations, managing complex risk exposures, and simplifying programme administration for HR teams who are increasingly feeling the pressure.
Organisations also want to invest in their people — attracting and retaining the best talent and giving their employees benefits that truly benefit themselves and their loved ones.
We understand the importance of balancing both. Too often this balancing act is viewed as an ""either/or”. But we see it differently. When both sides of the equation are in sync, you create a virtuous circle whereby one reinforces the other — and your people and business emerge stronger.
Workplace well-being programmes are effective tools in improving your employee’s productivity, health and well-being. Key components include access to high-quality, accessible and affordable health care, the use of digital health to engage employees in a more personalised, social and convenient manner as well as evaluating ways of working to help manage psychosocial risks.
Business leaders who adopt a human-centred design method that utilises data to drive decisions on what employees in their company need, will create a programme that improves workforce engagement, boosts organisation-wide culture and morale, as well as reduces risk of injury or harm.
A sound employee well-being programme starts with listening to employees and engaging the business on how health impacts the business. Using proven methodologies and analytical tools, we can help you build a roadmap with transformative solutions. 
We’ve seen many times that the more healthy and robust a workplace culture, the less prescriptive policies need to be. This is why it is crucial to have a healthy and safe culture that provides a platform for employees to innovate, collaborate and perform. Improved productivity is a welcome consequence, with happier and more fulfilled experiences at work.

At Mercer, we are creating a culture of belonging where all colleagues can bring their whole selves to work and thrive.
Having a diverse workforce and an inclusive culture makes us stronger as an organisation and improves the quality of our work. By working with curiosity, care and integrity to understand the needs of our colleagues and clients, we help enable their success.
Understanding and valuing the strengths of all our colleagues is core to our purpose at Mercer. Because we recognise that the unique talents and experiences our colleagues bring to the work they do each day add up to a more complete perspective. Nurturing a culture where everyone can be themselves and feel a sense of belonging leads to richer discussions, more innovative ideas and — ultimately — greater impact. Below are details about Mercer’s approach, strategy and actions, and commitments.

We’re developing leaders, people managers and colleagues to be visible allies and sponsors for Black, Indigenous and people of colour (BIPOC) colleagues.
Thriving:
We’re delivering equitable learning, development, promotions and rewards to all colleagues.
How are we building a diverse workforce and inclusive culture?
Advocacy
Mercer has a longstanding practice of reviewing pay and promotion decisions to identify and mitigate bias. We are committed to expanding this focus to other core business practices and policies.
Mercer offers a mix of regional and local mentorship programmes to help elevate BIPOC colleagues through career sponsorship.
Learning
We continuously build organisational capability to sustain an inclusive workplace.
Colleagues are required to attend learning sessions and certify that they understand the concepts of unconscious bias, being an ally and respect at work. People managers participate in additional forums to discuss creating and sustaining an inclusive culture.
Leadership accountability
Business leaders of large organisations have multiyear goals to increase representation of BIPOC colleagues in critical roles. At Mercer, leaders create a plan for engaging, retaining and developing BIPOC colleagues.
Mercer has instituted practices designed to attract and hire diverse talent. We’re de-biasing job postings and diversifying and training our hiring managers and interview teams.
Listening better
We’ve created a series of listening sessions and colleague experience surveys with the aim of better informing and driving our actions. We use these tools to increase awareness and understanding of differences across many diversity dimensions.
We’ve established diversity advisory councils at the enterprise and local levels to guide actions with local leaders.
Business resource groups (BRGs)
Our BRGs are an integral part of Mercer’s ability to succeed in building a culture of belonging.
Made up of colleagues who voluntarily work together to help Mercer achieve its diversity vision, each BRG plays a critical role in improving our firm’s culture and environment. Providing unique perspectives from across our organisation, each BRG focuses on our abilities to hire, develop and retain the best talent; work with an increasingly diverse client base; and connect to the increasingly diverse communities in which our colleagues and clients live and work. We currently have BRGs across Mercer from the following communities: Racial and Ethnic Diversity, Women@Mercer, Rising Professionals Network, AccessABILITIES and Pride.

Transformation
Successful change management begins with a strong and shared vision

Deliver stronger performance during change
We are in a time of extraordinary, consistent change. The pressure to adapt, both professionally and personally, is constant. In fact, according to Mercer's Global Talent Trends, 97% of organisations are planning significant transformation this year.
Creating a clear and shared vision makes all the difference for organisational change.
Companies with effective change management strategies and plans outperform their competition across many important financial indicators — delivering stronger performance during times of disruption or transformation.
Create sustainable change
At Mercer, we deploy five levers — throughout the change management process — to create sustainable change. We:
One
Align leadership and define reason for change 
Two
Engage stakeholders and co-create to build a desirable future
Three
Communicate to set expectations, mitigate risk and promote the change narrative
Four
Enable to create deeper understanding and acceptance 
The advantages of our change management consulting approach
Effective change does not happen by accident. It depends on the implementation of thoughtful change strategies, and on people — from leaders to front-line employees — understanding, embracing and activating the change.
Create understanding
Help people in your organisation understand the nature and necessity of change by involving them in the process from the beginning of the journey.
Inspire commitment and excitement
Create commitment and excitement so that people want to be part of the envisioned future state. Focus simultaneously on the logical and emotional aspects of change, both of which affect people’s decisions and behaviour.
Make change happen
Achieve success by making the change feel tangible and real for all of your employees. Provide clear communication to reinforce your message, and monitor the experience to ensure accountability and sustainability.

Take steps to advance equality
Mercer helps organisations with diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) consulting to advance equitable career, health and financial wellness outcomes in the workforce.

Accelerate diversity, equity and inclusion
Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) has become intrinsic to and synonymous with organisational health in today's world. Evidence shows companies that take steps to advance equality not only make a difference to their people and to the communities they serve — but also to their business.
Historically, DEI has occupied a less prominent seat at the corporate table. Today, internal and external pressure is driving companies to commit and show consistent progress. People sustainability and DEI are a key part of the “S” in environmental, social and governance (ESG) initiatives — and are now table stakes for every business. Organisations that are accelerating progress treat DEI in the workplace like any other core business imperative: having a strategy, engaging stakeholders, tracking and sharing progress, and holding leadership accountable for results.
It’s more critical than ever that companies understand that a DEI strategy is more than a differentiator — it’s foundational to growth and success.
There’s still a lot of work to be done with DEI in the workplace
80%
of organisations say improving DEI is high on their agendas.
50%
of organisations set goals for DEI outcomes.
42%
of organisations have established a multiyear DEI strategy.
Source: Let’s Get Real About Equality research, 2020.
Ensure long-term, sustainable progress with your DEI strategy
We help our clients accelerate their DEI journeys through a multifaceted, evidence-based approach that incorporates opportunity, experience, pay, and health and financial well-being interventions and outcomes.
