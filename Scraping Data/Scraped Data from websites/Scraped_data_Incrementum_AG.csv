Contact us
We specialise in asset management and professional portfolio management for private investors and maintain a personal relationship with our clients based on continuity and trust. Based on our many years of experience in the field of investment, we attach great importance to integrating environmental and social factors as well as aspects of good corporate governance. Our clients can rest assured that their capital is invested and managed responsibly.

The performance data for the mandate stems from the client’s custodian bank, Bank Julius Bär AG. The performance data for the benchmark indices derive from finanzen.ch. We draw your attention to the fact that past performance is no guarantee for future performance and that we can’t foresee the future. IPCP = Incrementum Private Client Portfolio
Individual needs require individual solutions.
We manage our customers’ portfolios in the same way farmers tend their fields, always with a view to sustainable yields. Our investments focus on participation in companies whose business models generate sustainable positive cash flows and who are prepared to share these with investors in the form of distributions.
Our clients always directly own the assets held through the custodian bank of their choice in Liechtenstein or Switzerland. Thanks to our contacts and long-standing business relationships, and the fact that we do not accept any form of reimbursement such as retrocessions and/or issuing commissions, etc., from banks and/or other financial service providers, our clients benefit from very favourable conditions.

The gold standard of gold research
THE GOLD STANDARD OF GOLD RESEARCH
Every end of May, Incrementum publishes one of the most comprehensive gold studies worldwide. Here you can read and download a compact version for free. The new In Gold We Trust-Report was published on 17 May 2024.
There are few who analyse and understand the gold market as thoroughly as Ronald Stöferle and his team. His annual “In Gold We Trust” is a must-read in our house!
Philipp Vorndran
Market strategist, Flossbach von Storch
The value of gold depends on three vectors - money, mining and geopolitics. Most analysts look at only one or two of these vectors. Incrementum's annual report ›In Gold we Trust‹ is the only research that looks at all three in depth and in an integrated fashion. It is the most eagerly awaited and closely read report in the gold community. Don't miss it!

 Possible conflicts of interest
Incrementum AG is an owner-managed company specializing in the provision of highly professional financial services. The constant respect for and the interests of the customers, as well as their fair treatment, have the highest priority. Incrementum AG seeks to permanently protect and reconcile the interests of its customers, shareholders and employees. Nevertheless, conflicts of interest in a company providing different financial services cannot always be completely ruled out. In accordance with the statutory provisions, Incrementum AG therefore informs about its precautions for dealing with potential conflicts of interest.
Conflicts of interest may arise between the companies, the management, the owner, the employees or other persons associated with Incrementum AG and their customers or between their customers.
The consistent customer orientation in the corporate culture is the central instrument to avoid influencing non-judgmental interests in consulting, order execution, asset management or other services. Great care in selecting employees, commitment to the highest standards and respect for international market opportunities help Incrementum AG to put customer interests at the center of its actions.
Organizational measures to avoid conflicts of interest
Incrementum AG has taken the following measures to prevent potential conflicts of interest:
Create a compliance function that is responsible for identifying, avoiding and managing potential conflicts of interest and taking appropriate measures where necessary;
Establishing and maintaining a client and risk-oriented organization that ensures the financial and regulatory integrity of the Company at all times;
Organizational measures to safeguard customer interests in investment advice and asset management;
Arrangements for the acceptance and granting of benefits and their disclosure;
The delineation of business areas and functions from each other and simultaneous control of the flow of information among each other (as far as this makes organizational sense);
Arrangements concerning the treatment and disclosure of proprietary transactions in financial instruments of employees and institutions;
Rules governing the acceptance of gifts and other benefits by employees and organs;
When executing orders, Incrementum AG acts in accordance with its Best Execution Policy or the instructions of the client;
The remuneration system is designed to prevent conflicts of interest, including those related to sustainability risks. It is intentionally neutral, meaning there are no incentives to either take on or avoid specific sustainability risks. At all times, the interests of the client are prioritised within our remuneration framework. Consequently, there are no incentives to acquire financial instruments, nor are there incentives for frequent buying and selling of financial instruments;
The company does not exercise any shareholder rights within the meaning of art. 367h par. 1 fig. 2 and 4 PGR based on participation in the companies in which the company is invested within the scope of asset management mandates. The participation policy of Incrementum AG can be found here;
Ongoing training of the employees.
Disclosure of potential or actual conflicts of interest
Conflicts of interest that can not be avoided and which may arise will be disclosed to the clients concerned prior to a general contract, special transaction or advice.
There are no retrocession agreements or other agreements between Incrementum AG and banks or other third parties regarding partial reimbursement on custody fees, stock exchange and trustee commissions, brokerage fees or other fees. For the customer, the (special) conditions agreed with the respective bank are used.
For efficient portfolio management, Incrementum AG also uses investment funds that are launched and managed by Incrementum AG. When using such products, no double charge of the customer.
The selection of funds or other products – be it directly in the customer portfolio or indirectly via investment funds managed by Incrementum AG – is carried out exclusively on the basis of customary, qualitative and quantitative selection criteria (best-in-class approach). All purchases of funds and other products are always made in the best interests of the client, whenever possible at net interest rates or against reimbursement of inventory commissions or closing commissions in favor of the client or fund.
Incrementum AG receives from other service providers, e.g. Brokers, gratuitous or discounted payments in connection with securities transactions, such as financial analysis or other informational material, training and, in part, technical services and equipment for accessing third-party information systems. The receipt of such donations is not directly related to the services rendered to the customer. Incrementum AG uses these grants to provide its services in the high quality claimed by the customer and to continuously improve them.
Partly, Incrementum AG pays success-based commissions and fixed fees to tied or independent intermediaries who supply Incrementum AG with or without reference to a specific business to customers or individual transactions. In addition, tied agents may also receive direct payments from third parties, in particular, fund companies and securities issuing houses, in addition to the agency fees paid by Incrementum AG.
Financial analyzes prepared or disseminated by Incrementum AG are also inform about relevant potential conflicts of interest.

  Our processing of personal data of our users is limited to those data which are necessary for the provision of a functional website as well as our contents and services. The processing of personal data of our users is only carried out for the purposes agreed with them or if there is another legal basis (in the sense of the DSGVO). We only collect personal data that is actually required for the performance and processing of our tasks and services or that you have voluntarily provided to us.

  This data and information is stored for data security reasons in order to ensure the stability and operational security of our system. We store them for a maximum period of 1 month. The legal basis for the temporary storage of the data and the log files is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR.
  In addition, this data and information are also used to analyse the use of our website (see point 3).
  3.     Web analysis and targeting tools
a.     Matomo Analytics
We analyse the use of our website using the open-source software tool Matomo (formerly Piwik; privacy policy declaration can be found at https://matomo.org/privacy-policy/). When individual pages of our website are accessed, the following data is stored:

This helps us to continuously improve our website and its user-friendliness. These purposes are also our legitimate interest in processing the data in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR.

  a.     Facebook Pixel
Current information on the EuGH judgment of 07-16-2020
The ruling of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) has declared the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Agreement invalid, which is why we have temporarily removed all scripts that transfer personal data to third-party providers in the U.S. until a new legal situation is resolved. This also applies to the web analytics and targeting tool Facebook Pixel listed below.
With your consent, this website uses the Facebook Pixel of the social network “Facebook” (Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, California 94304, USA). This serves the purpose of presenting visitors to our website with interest-based advertisements during their visit to the social network Facebook. A direct connection to the Facebook servers is established via the Face-book pixel when visiting our website. In the process, it is transmitted to the Facebook server that you have visited our website and Facebook assigns this information to your personal Facebook user account. We would like to point out that we, as the provider of the website, have no knowledge of the content of the transmitted data or its use by Facebook.

  Incrementum uses so-called cookies on the website. Cookies are small text files that are stored in the cache of your browser to enable recognition of your browser and to make your visit to our website even more attractive. Currently, only so-called session cookies are stored.
  Session cookies automatically lose their validity when you leave the website. Persistent cookies remain on your terminal device for a longer period until you delete them.

You can restrict or deactivate the storage of cookies in your browser settings at any time, but this may lead to restrictions in the functions and user-friendliness of our website.
  5.     Data processing via contact form and when contacting us
  You can contact Incrementum directly by email contact@incrementum.li, telephone +423 237 26 66 or fax +423 237 26 67. Incrementum collects, processes and uses the personal data and information you provide via these channels and via the contact form on the website (title, first and last name, e-mail address, subject and content of your message) exclusively for the purpose of processing your request. If they are no longer required to fulfil the above-mentioned purpose or on the basis of other justifiable grounds pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1 GDPR (e.g. contract initiation and fulfilment, statutory retention periods, legitimate interests), they will be deleted.
  6.     Newsletter
  On our website you can register for our electronic newsletter. Insofar as you have given your consent to receive the newsletter (Art. 6 para. 1 let. a GDPR), we will use your e-mail address you have provided, your title, your first name and surname exclusively to send you current information from Incrementum AG. We record your investor type and your domicile in order to comply with the regulatory requirements of product governance under MiFID II. We ask for your language in partial so that we can send you targeted information in your desired language. Since only professional investors are admitted to some funds, we sometimes also ask for the company name.
  After successful registration for the newsletter, you will automatically receive an e-mail asking you to confirm your e-mail address. As soon as you have confirmed your e-mail address by clicking on the link contained in the confirmation e-mail, you will regularly receive the newsletter you have selected. In the newsletter email you can unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time and revoke your consent. Your email address, salutation, first and last name, investor type, domicile, language and company name will then be deleted from the system immediately. Technically, the newsletter is processed via Mailchimp.
  MailChimp is a newsletter delivery platform of the US provider Rocket Science Group, LLC, 675 Ponce De Leon Ave NE #5000, Atlanta, GA 30308, USA. The e-mail addresses of Incrementum newsletter recipients, as well as their other data described in the notes, are stored on MailChimp servers in the USA. However, no sensitive data such as credit card details, etc. are transmitted to Mailchimp. MailChimp uses this information to send and evaluate the newsletters on behalf of Incrementum. Furthermore, according to its own information, the dispatch service provider may use this data in pseudonymous form, i.e. without assigning it to a user, to optimize or improve its own services, e.g. to technically optimize the dispatch and display of the newsletters or for statistical purposes to determine which countries the recipients come from. However, the mailing service provider does not use the data of Incrementum newsletter recipients to write to them itself or to pass it on to third parties. Incrementum trusts in the reliability and IT and data security of MailChimp. MailChimp is certified under the Privacy Shield agreement and thus offers a guarantee of compliance with the European data protection level. In addition, Incrementum has concluded a “Data Processing Agreement” with MailChimp. This is a contract in which MailChimp undertakes to protect the data of Incrementum newsletter subscribers, to process it in accordance with their data protection provisions on behalf of Incrementum and, in particular, not to pass it on to third parties. Please visit www.mailchimp.com for more information about Mailchimp, its privacy policy and terms of use.
  Currently, an alternative evaluation process is underway regarding the above-mentioned program.
  7.     File downloads
  We do not require you to provide any personal information in order to download files from our website.
         III.          Data security
  We use the widespread SSL procedure in connection with the highest encryption level supported by your browser when visiting our website. You can see whether an individual page of our website is transmitted in encrypted form by the closed display of the key or lock symbol in the address bar of your browser.
In addition, we apply further appropriate technical and organisational security measures to protect your data against accidental or intentional manipulation, partial or complete loss, destruction or against unauthorised access by third parties. Our security measures are continuously improved in line with technological developments.

None of the information on this website constitutes an invitation to purchase, but is intended solely for information and use by the recipient. Accordingly, no buy or sell orders placed via the message window or e-mail will be accepted. Furthermore, none of the information on this website constitutes a recommendation to buy or sell investment products or to engage in other transactions. Advice from a qualified person is recommended before investment or other decisions are made. This applies in particular to persons with US domicile or US nationality.
No warranty/ No guarantee
Incrementum compiles and regularly updates the contents of this website with great care. Nevertheless, the data serves only for general information of a non-binding nature and does not replace detailed individual advice for an investment decision. Market and investment reports on this website have been written by our staff. The information and opinions presented on this website originate from sources which we deem to be reliable. Despite all care taken, the data may have changed in the meantime or are based on incorrect information provided by third parties. However, we provide no undertaking or guarantee for the accuracy, completeness or legality of the information contained in this website. The contents of the information contained in this website may be changed at any time due to changed circumstances, whereby we are under no obligation to update once published information.

Warning about risks
This website has been established by Incrementum exclusively for the purposes of information. The information contained on the website is not to be understood under any circumstances as an investment recommendation or as legal, taxation or other advice. Please note that investments mentioned on this website may involve significant risks including the loss of the entire capital invested. More specifically, please note that the value of an investment may fall as well as rise. A gain in value in the past therefore provides no guarantee of positive performance in the future.

Therefore, products mentioned in this website are considered only for privat and professional investors who understand the risks involved and who are able to bear such risks from an economic perspective. Furthermore, potential investors should also inform themselves about the tax consequences that may arise from the purchase, possession and sale of investment products in their place of residence and always seek advice in their place of residence.

URANIUM
RESOURCES
FUND
Nuclear power will also play an important role in the future energy mix. It supplies low-CO2-produced, round-the-clock base load for the power grid. Uranium is the raw material used to operate such nuclear power plants. To meet the growing demand for uranium, production will have to be greatly expanded in the coming years. This gives interesting investment opportunities for the long-term investor.
URF-Website

LLB Incrementum fund depot
Uranium remains relevant
Nuclear power plants provide low-CO2 produced, 7x24 available base load for the power grid
Supply gap
in the uranium market
will be closed
Rising uranium prices provide the incentive to build up the necessary production capacity
Long-term
investment
The Fund is suitable for the long-term investor who would like to participate in the prospects of the uranium sector
Nuclear power is making a comeback!
According to the international community’s climate targets, the growing demand for electricity should increasingly be met from non-fossil sources in future. In addition, the electricity supply should remain reliable, secure and affordable. Alternative energies (wind, solar and hydropower) cannot achieve this on their own due to weather-related fluctuations in production. Nuclear power, which produces electricity with low CO2 emissions and provides a base load in the electricity grid around the clock, seven days a week, is an obvious addition. These qualities are convincing decision-makers worldwide. The capacity of the global reactor fleet is being expanded accordingly, by extending the operating life of existing reactors, building new nuclear power plants and developing new, flexible and safe reactor concepts. These developments are creating a growing demand for uranium as a commodity.
 Due to low uranium prices, too little has been invested in the production capacities of the uranium sector over many years. As a result, demand exceeds supply. There is a supply gap on the physical uranium market. In order to rebalance the market, this supply gap must be closed. This will only work if there is an incentive to expand production thanks to rising uranium prices. This opens up interesting investment opportunities for long-term investors.
 The investments underlying this financial product do not take into account the EU criteria for environmentally sustainable economic activities.

Cumulative Performance
Contact us
We specialise in asset management and professional portfolio management for private investors and maintain a personal relationship with our clients based on continuity and trust. Based on our many years of experience in the field of investment, we attach great importance to integrating environmental and social factors as well as aspects of good corporate governance. Our clients can rest assured that their capital is invested and managed responsibly.
Cumulative Performance
The performance data for the mandate stems from the client’s custodian bank, Bank Julius Bär AG. The performance data for the benchmark indices derive from finanzen.ch. We draw your attention to the fact that past performance is no guarantee for future performance and that we can’t foresee the future. IPCP = Incrementum Private Client Portfolio
Individual needs require individual solutions.
We manage our customers’ portfolios in the same way farmers tend their fields, always with a view to sustainable yields. Our investments focus on participation in companies whose business models generate sustainable positive cash flows and who are prepared to share these with investors in the form of distributions.
Our clients always directly own the assets held through the custodian bank of their choice in Liechtenstein or Switzerland. Thanks to our contacts and long-standing business relationships, and the fact that we do not accept any form of reimbursement such as retrocessions and/or issuing commissions, etc., from banks and/or other financial service providers, our clients benefit from very favourable conditions.

This applies in particular to persons domiciled in the USA or having US nationality. If you are uncertain about the sales restrictions or the significance of information published on this website, please contact your financial consultant or other professional advisor. The decision to invest in a product described on this website or to make use of relevant services should only be taken on the basis of the sales material in question (e.g.,. prospectus).

None of the information on this website constitutes an invitation to purchase, but is intended solely for information and use by the recipient. Accordingly, no buy or sell orders placed via the message window or e-mail will be accepted. Furthermore, none of the information on this website constitutes a recommendation to buy or sell investment products or to engage in other transactions. Advice from a qualified person is recommended before investment or other decisions are made. This applies in particular to persons with US domicile or US nationality.

INCREMENTUM
ALL SEASONS
FUND
Financial market seasons have been increasingly influenced by the end of the secular debt cycle and are accompanied by financial repression and long-term negative real interest rates. We aim to tackle these changes with a global, benchmark independent, all-seasons investment strategy.
Fund data
Contact us
LLB Incrementum Fondsdepot
All Weather Approach
One portfolio, adapting to the prevailing market season and utilizing the whole universe of asset classes and currencies
Active
Management
Macro- and micro-economic analysis is married in our trend-, theme- and value-based investment approach
In Pursuit
of Real Returns
Our primary goal is to increase the purchasing power of funds invested over the market cycle
The right investment, no matter the market season
Our Incrementum All Seasons Fund (IASF) pursues a long-term, global investment strategy that encompasses all asset classes permitted within a UCITS umbrella. Based on our macro analysis, we do not invest index- and trend-, but theme- and value-orientated, as well as active and benchmark-independent. Our aim is to achieve real, i.e. inflation-adjusted growth of the funds invested.

Overall, IASF is particularly suitable for long-term, risk-conscious investors, to whom we offer a high degree of transparency about our investment process and positioning through our regular reporting via our Seasonal Reflections .

The investments underlying the fund do not take into account the EU criteria for environmentally sustainable economic activities.

INCREMENTUM ACTIVE COMMODITY FUND

Fund data
Questions & Answers
LLB Incrementum fund depot
Diversification
Strategic allocation in stocks and corporate bonds across five commodity sub-sectors

Tactical exposure management driven by a systematic approach

Strategic exposure in corporate bonds in the commodity sector (40%): Investment-grade corporate bonds provide yield and reduce volatility

Tactical commodity exposure (-50% to +100%): Managed via the Bloomberg Commodity Index Future using the Incrementum inflation signal

Questions & Answers
What are the key changes resulting from the repositioning and transition of the Incrementum Inflation Diversifier Fund into the Incrementum Active Commodity Fund?
Investment Focus: The fund will now focus exclusively on investments in the commodity sector.
Allocation: The strategic cash portfolio will consist of 40% corporate bonds from the commodity sector, 50% commodity stocks equally selected from five commodity sub-sectors, and cash. The strategic core portfolio will be supplemented by active commodity management, systematically guided by the Incrementum inflation signal, which will adjust the total exposure: in defensive scenarios, it will be strategically reduced to 50%, while in offensive scenarios, it will be increased to 200%.
Inflation signal: The inflation signal will now be used exclusively for the active management of commodities through the Bloomberg Commodity Index Future.
Hurdle Rate: The new hurdle rate is the Bloomberg Commodity Index Total Return.
Further information is available in our report “Information on Repositioning – January 2025.” For any additional questions, please contact us at iacf@incrementum.li – we will answer your request as soon as possible.

 The investments underlying our financial products do not take into account the EU criteria for environmentally sustainable economic activities.
Annual performance in % - 12/2023

Persons who access information published on this website and who wish to retrieve non-binding information on this website declare their agreement with the following conditions:
  Local legal restrictions
  Access to information contained on this website as well as products or services which are described on this website may be prohibited for certain users as a result of local laws and regulatory provisions. For those persons who are subjected to such constraints, the access to this Incrementum website (this definition also includes in the following its subsidiaries and associated companies) is prohibited. This applies in particular to persons domiciled in the USA or having US nationality. If you are uncertain about the sales restrictions or the significance of information published on this website, please contact your financial consultant or other professional advisor. The decision to invest in a product described on this website or to make use of relevant services should only be taken on the basis of the sales material in question (e.g.,. prospectus).
  No recommendation, no offer
  None of the information on this website constitutes an invitation to purchase, but is intended solely for information and use by the recipient. Accordingly, no buy or sell orders placed via the message window or e-mail will be accepted. Furthermore, none of the information on this website constitutes a recommendation to buy or sell investment products or to engage in other transactions. Advice from a qualified person is recommended before investment or other decisions are made. This applies in particular to persons with US domicile or US nationality.
  No warranty/ No guarantee
  Incrementum compiles and regularly updates the contents of this website with great care. Nevertheless, the data serves only for general information of a non-binding nature and does not replace detailed individual advice for an investment decision. Market and investment reports on this website have been written by our staff. The information and opinions presented on this website originate from sources which we deem to be reliable. Despite all care taken, the data may have changed in the meantime or are based on incorrect information provided by third parties. However, we provide no undertaking or guarantee for the accuracy, completeness or legality of the information contained in this website. The contents of the information contained in this website may be changed at any time due to changed circumstances, whereby we are under no obligation to update once published information. In particular, Incrementum shall not be obliged to remove any outdated information from the Incrementum website or to expressly mark it as being outdated.
  Warning about risks
  This website has been established by Incrementum exclusively for the purposes of information. The information contained on the website is not to be understood under any circumstances as an investment recommendation or as legal, taxation or other advice. Please note that investments mentioned on this website may involve significant risks including the loss of the entire capital invested. More specifically, please note that the value of an investment may fall as well as rise. A gain in value in the past therefore provides no guarantee of positive performance in the future. Investments in foreign currencies are subject in addition to exchange rate fluctuations. Investments involving high volatility can be subject to high price fluctuations. These price fluctuations may equal or even exceed the value of the invested amount. The preservation of the invested capital cannot be guaranteed. Certain information may concern investments that cannot be realised directly. It may be difficult for investors to sell such investments, take profits on them or receive reliable information on their value or risk exposure. When buying or selling leverage investments, investors may not only lose the amount initially invested, they may also be required to pay an additional amount. Therefore, products mentioned in this website are considered only for privat and professional investors who understand the risks involved and who are able to bear such risks from an economic perspective. Furthermore, potential investors should also inform themselves about the tax consequences that may arise from the purchase, possession and sale of investment products in their place of residence and always seek advice in their place of residence.

We expressly point out the danger of viruses and the possibility of hacker attacks. Incrementum cannot provide any guarantee that the information, software or other material which is made accessible through this website is free of viruses, worms, Trojan horses or other damaging components.The use of current browser versions and anti-virus software is therefore strongly recommended.

About the Uranium Resources Fund
Nuclear power will also play an important role in the future energy mix. It supplies low-CO2-produced, round-the-clock base load for the power grid. Uranium is the raw material used to operate such nuclear power plants. To meet the growing demand for uranium, production will have to be greatly expanded in the coming years. This gives interesting investment opportunities for the long-term investor.

Contact us
We specialise in asset management and professional portfolio management for private investors and maintain a personal relationship with our clients based on continuity and trust. Based on our many years of experience in the field of investment, we attach great importance to integrating environmental and social factors as well as aspects of good corporate governance. Our clients can rest assured that their capital is invested and managed responsibly.

The performance data for the mandate stems from the client’s custodian bank, Bank Julius Bär AG. The performance data for the benchmark indices derive from finanzen.ch. We draw your attention to the fact that past performance is no guarantee for future performance and that we can’t foresee the future. IPCP = Incrementum Private Client Portfolio
Individual needs require individual solutions.
We manage our customers’ portfolios in the same way farmers tend their fields, always with a view to sustainable yields. Our investments focus on participation in companies whose business models generate sustainable positive cash flows and who are prepared to share these with investors in the form of distributions.
Our clients always directly own the assets held through the custodian bank of their choice in Liechtenstein or Switzerland. Thanks to our contacts and long-standing business relationships, and the fact that we do not accept any form of reimbursement such as retrocessions and/or issuing commissions, etc., from banks and/or other financial service providers, our clients benefit from very favourable conditions.
