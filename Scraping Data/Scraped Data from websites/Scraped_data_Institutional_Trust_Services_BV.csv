More than 30 pension institutions & insurance companies in the Netherlands rely on ITS's expertise for collecting the look-through portfolio data and providing regulatory compliant reports.
FTK and QRT

ITS has a long-lasting experience in providing these reports for pension institutions. All required asset templates are provided including the required portfolio look-through information.  Stress test calculations and asset classifications are provided in line with the requirements. Together with the final report ITS also delivers the necessary cashflow detail for your actuaries to do their own checks and validations.

Dutch institutional asset owners and investment funds are required to disclose monthly and quarterly portfolio information and movements on the instrument type level and even on the ISIN level. The MER report shows the monthly securities movements at the ISIN level where the MESRAP report shows this on the instrument type level for the complete balance sheet.

AIFM(D) (annex IV)
As part of the reporting obligations under AIFMD, all European registered alternative asset managers marketing into the EU or EEA are now required to report to their particular jurisdiction under AIFMD. Non-EU alternative fund asset managers are also required to file in all jurisdictions into which they market. There are two Annex IV report categories. AIFM report; a consolidated view of assets managed and the AIF report; required for each fund detailing assets held, exposures and investor profiles. Our managed solution compiles your report with all the required information. Herewith we collect the necessary information from your fund custodian/depositary such as portfolio details or participant register details. Any necessary static or semi dynamic fund information or risk information is collected through bespoke files. 

Online
ITS uses market leading technology to ensure accuracy, consistency, timeliness, and availability of completed reports. Final reports are online available and ready for submission with the regulator.

ESG compliance services
The Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) brings new challenges, including new reporting obligations. These regulations are still young and subject to change, but it is still necessary to take steps in collecting the necessary data. ITS offers several practical solutions to provide you with the data you need to monitor your ESG strategy alignment
Exclusion monitoring
ITS screens your lookthrough portfolio against exclusion lists that are commonly used in the industry. We only need your latest lookthrough portfolio reported to the regulator in the FTK or QRT format and within a number of hours we provide you with a list of investments that deserve your attention.  ITS uses a continuous updated list of exclusions that is commonly used by many market participants.  

Principle adverse impact reports (SFDR)
Financial market participants have the obligation to perform a principle adverse impact screening 4 times a year based on the investments in the portfolio. ITS can support you in collecting these ESG metrics or indicators and reconcile these to your (look-through) portfolio. You will receive an aggregated score in the required format at the (sub)portfolio level.
