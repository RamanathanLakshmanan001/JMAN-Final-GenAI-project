In California, our Find Agent tool will list both Agents and Brokers who service your area that National General has agreements with. The agents are appointed by and represent us. They are compensated by us for the policies they produce and are not permitted to charge additional fees related to the insurance transaction. The brokers are not our agents and have no binding authority. A broker transacts business on behalf of and is compensated by the consumer; however, a broker may also receive compensation from the insurer if the consumer purchases a policy. A Broker is required to disclose to you all broker fees being charged as well as if it is entitled to receive compensation by the insurer. If you are unsure whether the person you contact is an agent or a broker, please ask.

RVs need a specialized approach to insurance
National General's specialized coverage is built to fit the RV lifestyle, providing dependability, flexibility and affordability, with coverage plans that go far beyond the basics to keep RVers on the open roads.
Specialized RV coverage options*
Personal Belongings
From laptops to linens, personal belongings are insured for their original cost new - not a depreciated amount - up to $3,000. Additional coverage can be added, too, for customers and their gear.
Vacation Liability
Specialized Equipment Coverage
Permanent Attachments
Full Replacement Cost Coverage
Purchase Price Guarantee Coverage
Countrywide Towing and Roadside Assistance
Emergency Expense Allowance
Additional free coverage included, with specialized options available:






RV trips get even better when there's money being saved along the way
Multi-vehicle discounts
Save up to 20% each year when you combine your RV and auto on one convenient policy. And if your RV and auto are ever involved in the same covered accident, you'll only be responsible for one deductible - not two.
Diminishing Deductibles
Storage Savings Option
Insurance coverage is only as good as the service it's backed by
24/7 claim service, from RV specialists.
When it comes down to it, insurance coverage is only as good as the service provided in the unfortunate event of a claim. National General's RV insurance is backed by claim professionals who are RV experts, not auto adjusters. They speak the same language as avid RVers and they understand the situations that can arise at any moment.
Can an RV be protected with ordinary auto insurance?
After an RV purchase, customers often seek out insurance coverage just like they would for their car or truck. But, it's not that simple and an RV is a big investment that shouldn't go unprotected. Check out the differences between specialized RV insurance vs. traditional auto insurance.

Protecting the livelihood of business owners
Business owners who rely on their vehicles to make a living, need a policy that's tailored to the specific needs of their business. Commercial vehicle coverage from National General provides the protection entrepreneurs need at affordable prices, so they can concentrate on what's most important - growing their business.

 
Coverages designed to keep small businesses moving
Tools Coverage
Non-Owned Auto Coverage
Any Auto Coverage
Contractual Liability for Additional Insureds
Pollution Liability
Accidental Death and Dismemberment
Why is commercial auto insurance important for a small business?
An automobile accident could affect the daily operations of a small business and hurt the bottom line! Good commercial auto insurance can mean the difference between going under and staying afloat in the case of damages or a lawsuit. It protects a company against severe financial loss due to property damage, theft, injury, and liability.
 
A commercial auto policy can also provide other essential coverages to keep customers on the job site - ones that a personal auto policy can't. That's why it's essential to purchase commercial auto insurance for any vehicle that used for business.

Agents The Agent Advantage
It all starts with a local agent
FIND AN AGENT

Why choose an independent agent?
Independent insurance agents help customers navigate the often-complex world of insurance to find the right coverage and protection at the best rates possible. Independent agents and brokers are not employees of National General or any other insurance company. They represent several insurance carriers, which gives them the ability to offer customers plenty of options.
 
Local independent agents choose which companies to represent, assuring that any product they offer is issued by a reliable company with solid financial strength. Some local agents specialize in auto, home or health insurance, while others offer a full suite of coverage. A local agent will help coordinate coverage to ensure customers get the best protection at the best price, without leaving gaps or enrolling customers in unnecessary coverage they don't need.
 
A local independent agent works for the customer, not the insurance carrier. They do the shopping, getting quotes from multiple different companies, taking the hassle away from the customers. In addition to finding the right coverage, an independent agent will also advocate for customers to help get claims processed and paid fairly and promptly.
 
A local independent agent can also provide regular reviews of coverage and rates to ensure customers have insurance that makes the most sense for them.

Insurance Umbrella
Extra protection for the unpredictable
Insurance is not only meant to protect you from visible and predictable losses, but also from the unexpected and unforeseen occurrences in life. As an endorsement on our homeowners policy, umbrella coverage will help protect your family's financial security when a serious claim results in a lawsuit.
What a Personal Umbrella Policy Covers
A Personal Umbrella Policy protects you from the things you might not consider. Like if a delivery person slips on your walkway after a snowstorm. Or your son's friend breaks his leg while jumping on your trampoline. Situations like these could result in a lawsuit, and they likely would not be covered by your homeowners insurance.
But with a Personal Umbrella Policy, you can rest assured knowing you have coverage for:
Liability lawsuits
Defense costs
Employment practices liability
Not-for-profit Director and Officer coverage
Worldwide coverage
READY TO ADD THIS POLICY?
Our independent agents are ready to help you find the right umbrella policy for you. Click here to speak with an agent today.

Questions about the claim process?
Read below for answers to some of the most common questions we get about the claim process.
 
How do I file a claim?
Call us at 1-800-468-3466. You'll need your policy number ready as well as details about the incident.
 
 
How can I help speed up the claim process?
Have driver's license, registration and insurance information handy
Keep policy information up-to-date
Capture the names, license plate numbers and insurance information of others involved
Get the police officer's name and department location, should they be involved
Capture landmarks and nearby cross-streets of the location
Take photos of the location, the vehicles involved, etc
Keep track of paperwork, police report, claim number and the claim representative's contact information

 
What happens to insurance premiums when a claim is filed?
Since there are many kinds of claims, there's no predicting exactly what will happen to an insurance premium following a claim. Some things that cause rates to increase include:
Numerous accidents over a short period of time
A history of reckless driving behavior
Accidents due to DWI or DUI

The best way to avoid increases in insurance premiums is to be a safe and responsible driver. Accidents happen. When they do, we're here to help.
 
 
How long does it take to process a claim?
Depending on the type of claim, it could take as little as 24 hours to process. The more details provided, the easier it will be for us to settle a claim quickly and accurately. More complicated claims, involving disputes, will take longer to process. It is our goal to make sure the claim process is as efficient as possible and we promise to work hard to settle claims in the shortest amount of time we can.
 
 
What should drivers do in the event of an accident?
Since there are many kinds of claims, there's no predicting exactly what will happen to an insurance premium following a claim. Some things that cause rates to increase include:
Be safe and move out of the way of traffic
Make sure everyone is okay
Call the authorities
Call National General: 1-800-468-3466
Exchange information, names, insurance information, license plate numbers and contact information for anyone involved, including witnesses
Document the date, time and location of the incident
Take photos
In the event of a hit-and-run, jot down any information possible vehicle description, license plate (even partial), etc
While it is natural to feel at fault after an accident, do not admit fault or assess blame

Renters Insurance

FIND AN AGENT
Home is more than just a roof over your head
Home is where you make memories. And whether you're renting an apartment, a dorm room, or anything in between, you deserve peace of mind and 360 degree protection.
 
Renters coverage from National General lets you customize your coverage for your unique situation. Our independent agents can also help you find dwelling, personal belonging and liability protection.
Why you need renter's insurance
Renters insurance is great for protecting your personal property from incidents like fires and storms. But did you know it can also cover so much more, like your laptop and bicycle? And that's important, because if an incident happens, you likely won't get enough protection from your landlord or apartment owner's insurance policy.
 
But with renter's insurance from National General, you can choose from a variety of coverage levels to fit your unique needs. You can also select the flexible and affordable payment that works best for your budget.
 
Protect yourself and your belongings with affordable renter's insurance from National General.

Insurance Collectables
Private Collections
Every collection tells a story, whether it’s Grandma's fine china that you inherited or the dusty vintage bottles of Merlot in your basement. And though you might have personal property coverage from your homeowners insurance policy, special items can have specific coverage limits. That's when collectibles insurance can help. Protect your prized possessions with collectibles insurance from National General. Our independent agents will work to find the right coverage for your collection, so you can stay focused on building your story.
Here's a few examples of the types of items we cover.
Fine Jewelry
Artwork
Musical Instruments
Sets of China
Antiques
Coverages You Might Need
Collections insurance is an additional endorsement that is added to your homeowners coverage. You can choose from two options:
Scheduled Personal Property
Having a schedule of insured valuables means that each item is insured for a specific amount, usually what it has been appraised for. If you ever do need to file a claim, your item will be restored or replaced with similar quality materials with no deductible charge to you.
Blanket Coverage
A blanket of coverage can be convenient if you often buy and sell collectible pieces but maintain a consistent dollar amount for the collection, or if you have many pieces similar in value.
