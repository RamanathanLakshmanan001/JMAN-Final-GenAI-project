Product FAQ
The insurance of revenue for projects under construction refers to a particular class of business interruption insurance and relates to the financial consequences of a project delay due to the occurrence of a material damage event to critical equipment during shipment.
Such insurance is known by various names such as
Advanced Loss of profit
Delay in start up
Project – Cargo Marine/ Consequential loss
WHY PURCHASE DSU ?
There is no legal requirement to obtain DSU insurance and so any incentive to do so arises purely from commercial or economical grounds.
 DSU cover is aimed at those who invest in new projects or expansion works and who want to protect against the negative effects on the planned revenue stream caused by a delay in completion.
Banks and financers who put up funds and loans will have an interest in DSU Cover.

There are certain treatments which are payable only after the Insured Person is continuously covered for a specified period.

If an Insured took a Policy in October, 2016, does not renew it on time and takes a Policy only in December 2017, and renewed it on time in December 2018, any claim for Cataract would not become payable, because the Insured Person was not continuously covered for twenty four months. If, he had renewed the Policy in time in October 2017 and then in October 2018, then he would have been continuously covered for twenty four months and therefore his claim for Cataract in the Policy beginning from October 2018 would be payable.

Yes. If Your Policy is renewed within thirty days after the expiry of the previous Policy, then the Continuity Benefits would not be affected. But even if You renew Your Policy within thirty days after expiry of previous Policy, any Illness contracted or Injury sustained or Hospitalization commencing during the break in insurance is not covered. Therefore it is in Your own interest to see that you renew the Policy before it expires.
Is there an age limit upto which the policy would be renewed?
No. Your Policy can be renewed, as long as you pay the Renewal Premium before the date of expiry of the Policy. There is an age limit for taking a fresh Policy, but there is no age limit for renewal. However, if you do not renew Your Policy before the date of expiry or within thirty days of the date of expiry, the Policy may not be renewed, and only a fresh Policy could be issued, subject to Our underwriting rules. In such cases, it is possible that a fresh Policy could not be issued by Us. It is therefore in your interest to ensure that Your Policy is renewed before expiry.
Can the insurance company refuse to renew the policy?
We may refuse to renew the Policy only under instances such as fraud, misrepresentation or non-disclosure of material facts or non-cooperation by You or any one acting on Your behalf in obtaining insurance or subsequently in relation thereto. If we discontinue selling this Policy, it will not be possible to renew this Policy on the same terms and conditions. In such a case you shall, however, have the option for renewal under any similar Policy being issued by the Company as on that date, provided the benefits payable shall be subject to the terms contained in such other Policy.
In case of revision or modification or withdrawal of the Policy a notice will be provided to You 90 days before such revision or modification or withdrawal.
Renewal can also be refused if the Policy is not renewed before expiry of the Policy or within the Grace Period.
Can I make a claim immediately after taking a policy?
Claims for Illnesses cannot be made during the first thirty days of a fresh Insurance Policy. However, claims for Hospitalization due to Accidents occurring even during the first thirty days are payable. There are certain treatments where the waiting period is twelve months and thirty six months are applicable. (Refer Q. No. 22 point 1,2,3 and Q. No. 23 for details)
Who will settle the claim?
Health claims are generally processed by Third Party Administrator (TPA). TPA is a service provider to facilitate service to you for providing Cashless facility for all Hospitalization that come under the scope of the Policy. The TPA also processes reimbursement claims within the scope of the Policy. Payment of reimbursement claims will be effected by Us by transfer to Your bank account.
What is cashless hospitalization?
Cashless Hospitalization is service provided by the TPA on Our behalf whereby You are not required to settle the Hospitalization expenses at the time of discharge from Hospital. The settlement is done directly by the TPA on Our behalf. However those expenses which are not admissible under the Policy would not be paid and You would have to pay such inadmissible expenses to the Hospital. Cashless facility is available only in Network Hospitals. Prior approval is required from the TPA before the patient is admitted into the Network Hospital.

You will have full freedom to choose the Hospitals from the Network Hospitals and avail Cashless facility on production of proof of Insurance and Your identity, subject to the claim being admissible. The TPA might not agree to provide Cashless facility at a Hospital which is not a Network Hospital. In such cases You may avail treatment at any Hospital of Your choice and seek reimbursement of the claim subject to the terms and conditions of the Policy. In cases where the admissibility of the claim could not be determined with the available documents, even if the treatment is at a Network Hospital, the TPA may refuse to provide Cashless facility. Such refusal may not necessarily mean denial of the claim. You may seek reimbursement of the expenses incurred by producing all relevant documents and the TPA may pay the claim, if it is admissible under the terms and conditions of the Policy.
Can I change hospitals during the course of my treatment?
Yes, it is possible to shift to another Hospital for reasons of requirement of better medical treatment. However, this will be evaluated by the TPA on the merits of the case and as per Policy terms and conditions.
How to get reimbursement for pre and post hospitalization expenses?
The Policy allows reimbursement of Medical Expenses incurred before and after admissible Hospitalization up to a certain number of days. For reimbursement, send all bills in original with supporting documents along with a copy of the discharge summary and a copy of the authorization letter to his/her TPA. The bills must be sent to the TPA within 7 days from the date of completion of treatment. You must also provide the TPA with additional information and assistance as may be required by the TPA in dealing with the claim.
Will the entire amount of the claimed expenses be paid?
The entire amount of the claim is payable, if it is within the Sum Insured and is related with the Hospitalization as per Policy conditions and is supported by proper documents, except the expenses which are excluded. The list of such excluded expenses is attached as Annexure II (LIST OF EXPENSES EXCLUDED ('NON-MEDICAL')) to the Policy.
