Message from the CEO
My vision has always been to embrace a dedicated team of professionals who are responsible to offer investment advice to clients after having listened to them and obtained a good understanding of their financial needs and investment objectives. Our philosophy is that getting to know each client well is fundamental in providing a good service. We see the client as a person and not just a number. We maintain close contact with our clients and most importantly review our customers’ financial situation on an ongoing basis because circumstances change. We assist and support our clients to achieve their investment objectives.  All of this is impossible without a strong work force, and this is why I believe that continuous professional development is essential in this line of business, and this is why we continue to nurture our employees at MZ Investments. We have continued to evolve throughout the years as a company and meeting my customers first hand remains my passion.
We assist clients to diversify their portfolios across different sectors, geographical area, prevailing market conditions whilst always keeping in mind clients’ financial needs and their risk profile. There are plenty of business opportunities, so long as we embrace our company’s Mission and Vision and treat each customer as a person fostering a life-long business relationship. Our priority always remains that of giving an excellent service to our clients, this is what is in line with our Mission Statement.

Capital raising
This involves assisting companies seeking to raise capital through initial public offerings, rights issues, or placements. This service also includes advising on the type, structure, timing, and pricing of the capital raising, as well as the coordination of the overall process that leads to capital being raised and/or listing obtained.
Treasury management
Comprises offering investment solutions that optimise liquidity and cash flows in support of the overall financial objectives of the corporate entity.
Research
Ahead of any capital raising exercise or major corporate action (such as merger and acquisition activity, or spinoff), extensive work is done with a view of ensuring that the corporate entity has the right credentials, organisation, and strategy in place for securing a feasible and successful outcome that lasts for many years. In this respect, our analysis looks at various aspects of the prospective capital raising exercise or corporate action, including the underlying dynamics of the local capital market; investor appetite and sentiment; macroeconomic forces; as well as the distinct characteristics, competitive landscape, and prospects of the market in which the corporate entity operates in.
Corporate governance and compliance
A lot of importance is placed on providing the necessary guidance for companies to adhere to all obligations in line with prevailing legislation, regulatory requirements, listing policies, as well as financial reporting and disclosures. This also includes the compilation of Financial Analysis Summary reports on an annual basis for eligible companies, which would contain financial forecasts and other matters related to strategy and governance.
Transaction advisory
This involves providing access to and/or facilitating the process of negotiation and execution of deals and investments that would typically take different forms depending on the nature of the business transaction. Assistance is also provided in the specific structuring of the deal, including terms and conditions, due diligence, valuation, as well as financing, legal and regulatory considerations.
Investor relations
Insight is provided on how best a corporate entity can maintain a healthy, ongoing, and long-lasting relationship with market participants including regulatory authorities, existing and potential investors, stockbroking firms, as well as other interested players. This often entails providing support in the presentation of financial information during analyst meetings, other direct communication with market participants, as well as advice in the formulation and upkeep of the companies’ online investor relations platform.

‘Our services are defined by a personal touch and built on trust’ – Laura Zahra
26 March, 2025
Author: Ramona Depares
With a distinguished 26-year legacy, MZ Investments has established itself as a trusted name in the financial sector, renowned for its long-term, client-centric approach. This well-earned reputation is the result of the unwavering dedication of its directors, employees, and the organisation as a whole, which has firmly ingrained these values within its corporate culture.
“This philosophy is one I inherited from my father, Martin Zahra, the company’s founder. Our ethos revolves around delivering personalised service, and we do not subscribe to a standardised approach. Instead, we tailor our solutions to meet each client’s specific needs. That is why we refer to MZ Investments as a boutique firm, and we take great pride in this distinction,” Laura begins.
Such a client-focused approach has resonated strongly with MZ Investments’ diverse client base, which includes high-net-worth individuals, institutional investors, corporate clients, and retail investors. The company has come a long way since its inception, evolving into a respected name in investment management, advisory services, stockbroking, and corporate broking. While it has expanded significantly, the core values that have shaped its reputation remain steadfast.
“Our services are meticulously designed to align with our clients’ financial objectives, risk appetites, and market perspectives. We take the time to understand each client on a deeper level, providing a personalised and responsive approach. Our process is thorough, aimed at ensuring that every client is fully satisfied with the service we deliver,” Laura explains.
As an Executive Director, Laura also leads three critical units within the company: Trading, Treasury, and the newly established Client Lifecycle Management Unit. The latter is dedicated to refining the entire client journey – from onboarding and regular servicing to periodic reviews and stringent quality control measures.
“My role requires me to wear many hats, spanning management, operational coordination, and team leadership,” she notes. “Efficiency is at the core of my leadership style, and I strive to optimise workflows to ensure seamless execution across all operations.”
A key element in driving this efficiency is the strategic integration of technology which is transforming decision-making processes and enabling more data-driven strategies. Laura is keen to leverage these dynamics to benefit clients – but with a unique approach.
“By embracing technology, we enhance operational efficiency and adaptability, allowing MZ Investments to remain agile in a rapidly evolving financial landscape,” she says. However, these tools are more deployed internally rather than client-facing.
“We will never replace our personal approach when it comes to client interactions, and our clients appreciate this. The investment landscape is built on trust, and cultivating a personal rapport is essential to fostering it,” she elaborates.
This personal connection extends beyond clients to the MZ Investments team, where communication and transparency are highly valued.
“I believe in fostering a collaborative and results-driven environment, where team members feel empowered to make informed decisions. Transparency and trust are integral to our culture, helping everyone stay aligned with our strategic direction. Brainstorming sessions and open communication are essential elements of our success and efficiency,” she continues.
Looking ahead, Laura remains committed to strengthening MZ Investments’ market position and expanding its client base.
“As part of our growth strategy, we are extending our services to a broader client spectrum while maintaining our bespoke, client-centric approach. With increasing regulatory demands, we are continuously enhancing our compliance frameworks to remain fully aligned with evolving financial regulations. Compliance is one of the most significant challenges in our industry, but we are resolute in upholding the highest standards. A strong compliance culture is deeply embedded within our operations, ensuring it remains a top priority at all times.”
Human capital is another area of focus, and Laura takes pride in the close-knit, supportive environment that MZ Investments has cultivated.
“We have an exceptionally low staff turnover rate. When people join us, they tend to stay, and we highly value this stability. I place great importance on professional development, which is why we continue to invest in our team and nurture their expertise. Our goal is to reinforce MZ Investments’ reputation as a trusted, forward-thinking financial institution that delivers long-term value and sustainable growth for our clients. Achieving this is only possible with a strong and dedicated team,” she states.
At the heart of all operations remain the principles instilled by Laura’s father, which have profoundly shaped her leadership style and professional ethos.
“His core principles continue to define MZ Investments: disciplined investing, clear financial goal-setting, and a deep understanding of risk,” Laura concludes. “That is the essence of what we offer – tailored, thoughtful, and always client-first.”

What we do
Discretionary Portfolio Management
Our discretionary portfolio management service provides a hassle-free investment solution where seasoned Portfolio Managers design and manage on your behalf a strategy tailored to your investment objectives and risk tolerance. With professional insights guiding every decision, you can achieve your investment goals without the burden of daily portfolio oversight.
Investment Advice
Our investment advice service is designed to help you make informed financial decisions and achieve your goals with confidence. We provide tailored recommendations based on a thorough analysis of your financial situation, risk tolerance and investment objectives.
Corporate Broking
We play a pivotal role in the local capital markets, representing a significant share of companies listed on the Regulated Main Market of the Malta Stock Exchange. Our corporate broking services are built on deep industry expertise, a strong reputation and a commitment to trust and long-term sustainable partnerships.
Stockbroking
We offer comprehensive stockbroking services catering to both self-directed investors through execution-only services and those seeking expert guidance with advisory execution. With access to local and international markets, we empower clients to diversify their portfolios and make informed investment decisions aligned with their financial goals.
Who we are
Established in 1999, MZ Investments brings decades of expertise in delivering investment services to both corporate and private clients. Licensed and authorised by the Malta Financial Services Authority we offer a wide range of investment services including investment advice, stockbroking services, discretionary portfolio management and nominee services.
As an enrolled Tied Insurance Intermediary for MAPFRE MSV Life we offer our clients a variety of insurance products including pensions, regular savings and lump sum investments.
We are committed to helping our clients achieve their financial goals through a personalized and dedicated professional service. Our unwavering commitment to excellence has positioned MZ Investments as a leading investment services provider in Malta.
Message from the CEO
My vision has always been to embrace a dedicated team of professionals who are responsible to offer investment advice to clients after having listened to them and obtained a good understanding of their financial needs and investment objectives. Our philosophy is that getting to know each client well is fundamental in providing a good service. We see the client as a person and not just a number. We maintain close contact with our clients and most importantly review our customers’ financial situation on an ongoing basis because circumstances change. We assist and support our clients to achieve their investment objectives.  All of this is impossible without a strong work force, and this is why I believe that continuous professional development is essential in this line of business, and this is why we continue to nurture our employees at MZ Investments. We have continued to evolve throughout the years as a company and meeting my customers first hand remains my passion.
We assist clients to diversify their portfolios across different sectors, geographical area, prevailing market conditions whilst always keeping in mind clients’ financial needs and their risk profile. There are plenty of business opportunities, so long as we embrace our company’s Mission and Vision and treat each customer as a person fostering a life-long business relationship. Our priority always remains that of giving an excellent service to our clients, this is what is in line with our Mission Statement.
